Person A: Hey 
Person B: Hey, how are you? 
Person A: Not great, actually. I've been struggling with substance abuse lately. 
Person B: I'm really sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about what you've been going through? 
Person A: It started off as just trying to have fun, but now it's getting out of control. I'm worried about my health and the impact it's having on my relationships. 
Person B: I understand how difficult it can be. Have you spoken to anyone about it, like a therapist or a support group? 
Person A: Not yet. I feel so ashamed and guilty about my addiction. 
Person B: Don't be so hard on yourself. Addiction is a disease, and seeking help is a courageous step. You deserve support and understanding. 
Person A: Thank you for saying that. It means a lot to me. I just don't know where to start. 
Person B: You're welcome! Taking that first step can feel overwhelming, but there are resources available to help you. There are helplines, treatment centers, and support groups in your area. 
Person A: I'll look into it. But what if I can't do it? What if I fail? 
Person B: Recovery is a journey, and setbacks are a normal part of it. It's important to have compassion for yourself and not give up. Remember, you're stronger than you think. 
Person A: I'll try. It won't be easy, but I'll give it my best shot. 
Person B: That's all anyone can ask of you. I believe in you, and I'm here to support you every step of the way. You're never alone in this.
