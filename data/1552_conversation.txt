Person A: Hey
Person B: Hey, how are you?
Person A: Not doing great, honestly. Feeling really overwhelmed lately.
Person B: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me what's been going on?
Person A: I've been dealing with a lot of stress at work and it's been affecting my sleep and appetite.
Person B: It sounds like your job is really taking a toll on you. Have you tried talking to your supervisor about it?
Person A: Yeah, I did. But it doesn't seem like they really understand or care.
Person B: I can understand how frustrating that must be. Have you considered seeking support outside of work, maybe through therapy or counseling?
Person A: I've thought about it, but I'm not sure if it would help. I don't want to burden anyone.
Person B: Seeking professional help doesn't mean you're burdening someone. It can actually provide you with the support and guidance you need. It's important to prioritize your well-being.
Person A: You're right. I shouldn't feel guilty about taking care of myself. I'll look into finding a therapist.
Person B: That's great to hear! Remember, it's important to reach out and not face these challenges alone. I'm here for you too, if you ever need to talk.
Person A: Thank you, I really appreciate that. It means a lot to know I have your support.
Person B: You're welcome. Remember, self-care is not selfish. Take the time to prioritize your own well-being.
