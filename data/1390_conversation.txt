Person A: Hey
Person B: Hey, how are you?
Person A: I'm feeling really overwhelmed lately.
Person B: I'm here for you. What's been going on?
Person A: I've been so stressed with work and I can't seem to find a balance.
Person B: It sounds like you're carrying a heavy load. Have you tried setting boundaries or talking to your boss about it?
Person A: I haven't really tried anything yet. I guess I'm afraid of disappointing others.
Person B: Remember, it's important to prioritize your own well-being. By setting healthy boundaries, you'll be more effective and content in the long run. What small steps can you take to start this process?
Person A: Maybe I can start by having a conversation with my boss about workload expectations.
Person B: That's a great idea. Remember, it's okay to advocate for yourself. You deserve to have a manageable workload. Let me know how the conversation goes.
Person A: Thank you for your support. I'll keep you updated.
Person B: Of course, anytime. Take care of yourself, and remember, you're not alone in this.
