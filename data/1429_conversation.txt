Person B: I understand. It's normal to feel overwhelmed at times. Have you been taking any time for self-care?
Person A: Not really, I've just been pushing through everything.
Person B: It's important to prioritize self-care. Taking small breaks and engaging in activities you enjoy can help reduce stress. What do you like to do to relax?
Person A: I used to enjoy painting, but I haven't found the time for it recently.
