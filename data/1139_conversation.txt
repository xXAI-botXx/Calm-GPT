Person A: Hey 
Person B: Hey, how are you feeling today? 
Person A: Ugh, I'm feeling really anxious. I have this big presentation tomorrow and I can't stop worrying about it. 
Person B: I understand, it's normal to feel anxious before a big event. But remember, you've prepared so well for this presentation. You've got this! 
Person A: I hope so, but what if I forget everything and make a fool of myself? 
Person B: It's natural to have those thoughts, but try not to dwell on the worst-case scenarios. Remember the last time you made a presentation, you did great! 
Person A: Yeah, you're right. I did do well then. 
Person B: Exactly. And to help distract you from these anxious thoughts, let me tell you a little story. Once upon a time, there was a little squirrel named Sam who was always scared to climb trees... 
Person A: Really? A squirrel? 
Person B: Yes, a squirrel. So one day, Sam met a wise owl who told him that he had the potential to be an excellent climber. The owl encouraged Sam to face his fears and try climbing a small tree. 
Person A: What happened next? 
Person B: Sam was hesitant at first, but with the owl's support, he climbed the tree and realized that he was capable of much more than he initially thought. From then on, Sam became the best tree climber in the forest. The end. 
Person A: That's a nice story. It's comforting to know that I can overcome my fears too. 
Person B: Absolutely! Just like Sam, you have the potential to overcome any challenges you face. Remember, you are capable and deserving of success. 
Person A: Thank you for the story and your encouraging words. I do feel better now. 
Person B: You're welcome! I'm here to support you. You're going to do amazing, and remember, I believe in you.
