Person A: Hey 
Person B: Hey, how are you? 
Person A: I'm feeling a bit anxious today... 
Person B: Oh no, sorry to hear that. Is there anything specific that's causing you anxiety? 
Person A: Not really, it's just this constant feeling of uneasiness. 
Person B: I see. Have you tried any relaxation techniques or breathing exercises? 
Person A: Yeah, but they don't seem to work for me. 
Person B: That's alright. Everyone is different. Have you considered seeking professional help? 
Person A: I have, but I'm not sure if therapy would help me. 
Person B: It's worth a try, don't you think? They can provide you with coping strategies and support. 
Person A: Maybe you're right. I'll look into it. 
Person B: That's great to hear. Remember, there's always hope and help available. You're not alone in this. 
Person A: Thanks, your positive attitude really helps. 
Person B: No problem, glad I could be of support. Is there anything else you need to talk about? 
Person A: Not at the moment, but thanks again for being there for me. 
Person B: Anytime. Take care and reach out whenever you need someone to talk to.
