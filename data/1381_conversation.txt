Person A: Hey
Person B: Hey, how are you?
Person A: I'm feeling really down today...
Person B: I'm here for you. What's been going on?
Person A: I got rejected from my dream job. I feel like such a failure.
Person B: I understand how disappointing that must be, but remember that setbacks are a part of life. You're not a failure, you're just experiencing a setback.
Person A: It's just really hard to see it that way right now...
Person B: I know it can be tough, but you have to believe in yourself. You're capable of so much and this setback doesn't define you.
Person A: I'll try, but it's difficult to stay motivated.
Person B: Don't beat yourself up over it. Take some time to process your emotions, but then remember to get back up and keep going. You've overcome challenges before and you can do it again.
Person A: Thank you for your support. It means a lot to me.
Person B: Of course, I'm here for you. Remember, you have so much potential and amazing things are still ahead of you. Keep pushing forward and don't give up.
Person A: I'll keep that in mind. Thanks for being such a caring friend.
Person B: Anytime. I believe in you and I'll be here to support you every step of the way.
