Person A: Hey, I've been feeling really down lately. 
Person B: I'm sorry to hear that. What's been going on? 
Person A: I've been struggling with my self-confidence and feeling like I'm not good enough. 
Person B: It's common to have those feelings sometimes. Can you tell me more about what's been triggering them? 
Person A: I think it's mainly coming from comparing myself to others and feeling like I don't measure up. 
Person B: Comparing ourselves to others can be a tough habit to break. Remember that everyone has their own unique journey. 
Person A: Yeah, that's true. But I just can't shake off this feeling of not being enough. 
Person B: Have you considered exploring your strengths and achievements to boost your self-esteem? 
Person A: I guess I haven't really given it much thought. Maybe that could help. 
Person B: Absolutely. Start recognizing and celebrating your accomplishments, big and small. It'll help shift your focus towards your positive attributes. 
Person A: Thank you for the advice. I'll give it a try. 
Person B: You're welcome. Remember, you are more than enough just the way you are.
