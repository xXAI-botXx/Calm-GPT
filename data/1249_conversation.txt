Person A: Hey, I've been feeling overwhelmed lately.
Person B: Hi there. What's been going on? 
Person A: I don't really know how to handle all these emotions.
Person B: It's okay to feel that way. Why don't you try acknowledging and accepting your emotions first? 
Person A: But they feel so intense and confusing. 
Person B: That's completely normal. Emotions can be complex. Have you tried journaling or talking to someone about how you're feeling? 
Person A: No, I haven't. I usually just push them aside. 
Person B: That's understandable, but it's important to address them. Journaling or talking to someone can help you gain clarity and process your emotions in a healthy way. 
Person A: I guess I can give it a try. 
Person B: That's great! Remember, it's okay to feel and it's important to take care of yourself. Let me know if you need any support along the way. 
Person A: Thank you, I really appreciate your help.
