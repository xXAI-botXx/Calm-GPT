Person A: Hey, I've been feeling really off lately and I just got diagnosed with Adjustment Disorder. It's been really tough for me.

Person B: Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear that! Can you tell me more about it? I'm here to listen and understand.

Person A: It's basically a mental health condition where I'm struggling to cope with significant changes or stressors in my life. It's been giving me a lot of anxiety and depression.

Person B: I see. That sounds challenging, but please know that I'm here to support you. How are you feeling right now?

Person A: Honestly, I'm feeling overwhelmed and lost. It's hard to focus and I constantly worry about things that shouldn't bother me.

Person B: I can imagine how that feels. Remember, you're not alone in this. Is there anything I can do to help right now?

Person A: It would mean a lot if you could just listen to me and understand what I'm going through. Sometimes it feels like nobody really understands.

Person B: Of course, I'm here to listen. I may not fully understand, but I genuinely want to learn and support you. You're important to me.

Person A: Thank you, that means so much to me. It's also been challenging for me to adjust to all these changes, and I just want to feel like myself again.

Person B: Change can be really tough, but try to give yourself grace in this process. Remember, it's okay to ask for help and take small steps toward healing and regaining balance.

Person A: I'll try. Sometimes, I feel guilty for struggling like this, especially when others seem to handle things effortlessly.

Person B: It's important to remember that everyone's journey is different. Comparing yourself to others will only make it harder. Focus on your own progress and take things one day at a time.

Person A: I'll keep that in mind. Thank you for being so understanding and positive. It really helps to have you by my side.

Person B: You're welcome! I care about you and want to support you in any way I can. Remember, you are strong and capable, and I believe in your ability to overcome this challenge.

Person A: Thank you for believing in me. It means more than you know.
