Person A: Oh no, I can't find my keys! I'm starting to panic!

Person B: Don't worry, I'm sure they're around somewhere. Why don't you take a deep breath and try to calm down?

Person A: I've already looked everywhere! I've checked my pockets, checked the table, even looked under the couch. They're just gone!

Person B: Okay, let's try to distract you for a moment. How about we play a little game? Count how many blue objects you can find in the room. That might help take your mind off the keys.

Person A: Okay, I'll give it a try. Let me see... There's a blue pen on the desk, a blue pillow on the couch, and a blue painting on the wall. That's three so far.

Person B: Great! Keep going. I'm sure there are more blue objects to be found.

Person A: Oh, I just spotted a blue mug in the kitchen and a blue book on the shelf. That makes five!

Person B: See, you're doing great! Keep searching and counting. I bet you'll find more blue objects around you.

Person A: You know what? You're right. I feel a little better already. Maybe taking my mind off the keys is the key to finding them.

Person B: That's the spirit! Sometimes, when we're focused on something too much, it helps to take a step back and divert our attention. I'm sure your keys will turn up soon.

Person A: Thanks for being here and helping me calm down. I'll continue counting blue objects and hopefully, I'll stumble upon my keys in the process.

Person B: You're welcome! I'm here to support you. Don't hesitate to ask if you need any more assistance. Good luck with your search!
