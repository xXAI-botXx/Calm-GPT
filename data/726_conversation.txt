Patient: Good morning, Dr. Smith. I've been feeling really anxious lately and I don't know why. 
Psychologist: Good morning, John. I'm here to help. Can you tell me more about what's been going on? 
Patient: Well, I've been having trouble sleeping, and I constantly feel on edge. My heart races and I have trouble focusing on anything. 
Psychologist: I see. When did these symptoms start? 
Patient: I first noticed them about two weeks ago. I thought it was just stress from work, but it's been getting worse. 
Psychologist: Have there been any major changes or events in your life recently that could be causing this increase in anxiety? 
Patient: Not really. Everything has been pretty stable. I can't pinpoint any specific trigger for these feelings. 
Psychologist: Sometimes, anxiety can arise without an obvious cause. Let's dig a little deeper. Have you been experiencing any negative thoughts or worries that could be influencing your anxiety? 
Patient: Now that you mention it, I have been worrying a lot about my future and my career. I feel a lot of pressure to succeed. 
Psychologist: It's not uncommon to feel anxious about the future and career prospects. Let's work on developing some coping strategies to help manage this stress. 
Patient: That sounds great, Dr. Smith. I really want to learn how to better deal with these feelings of anxiety. 
Psychologist: We'll start by exploring relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing exercises. We'll also address any underlying negative thoughts and work on reframing them in a more positive light. 
Patient: That sounds like a plan. I'm willing to put in the work to overcome this anxiety. 
Psychologist: I'm glad to hear that, John. Remember, it's a process, and I'm here to support you every step of the way. We'll get through this together.
