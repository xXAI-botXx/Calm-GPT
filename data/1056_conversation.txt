Person A: Hey, I've been feeling really down lately. 
Person B: I'm here for you. What's been going on? 
Person A: I've been struggling with anxiety and it's been affecting my daily life. 
Person B: I understand. Have you considered talking to a professional about it? 
Person A: I haven't, but maybe that could be helpful. 
Person B: It's definitely worth considering. A therapist can provide guidance and support.

Person B: Of course, anytime. Take care of yourself and remember that you're not alone in this.
