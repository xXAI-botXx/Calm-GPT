Person A: Not great, to be honest. I've been feeling really down lately. 
Person B: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me what's been bothering you? 
Person A: It's just a combination of things. Work has been really stressful, and I'm having trouble finding time for myself. On top of that, I've been having relationship issues.
