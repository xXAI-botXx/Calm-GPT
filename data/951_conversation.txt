Person A: I don't know what to do! I'm in such a panic right now.
Person B: Hey, calm down! Take a deep breath. What seems to be the problem?
Person A: I just found out that I lost my wallet with all my money inside. I don't know how I'm going to pay my bills.
Person B: I understand it's a stressful situation, but panicking won't solve anything. How about we take your mind off it for a while? Let's play a game to distract you.
Person A: I don't know if I can focus on a game right now, but I'll give it a try.
Person B: Great! Let's play a trivia game. I'll ask you questions about random topics, and you have to give me the answers.
Person A: Okay, let's do it. Anything to get my mind off this situation.
Person B: Here's your first question: What is the capital city of Australia?
Person A: Um… Sydney?
Person B: Nope, it's Canberra. Don't worry, let's try another one. What's the tallest mountain in the world?
Person A: Mount Everest!
Person B: Correct! See, you're doing great. Let's keep going. What's the scientific name for the fear of spiders?
Person A: Arachnophobia!
Person B: That's correct. You're nailing it! Let's keep playing until you forget about your wallet for a while.
Person A: Thank you for distracting me with this game. I actually feel a little calmer now.
Person B: You're welcome! Sometimes a little diversion can help clear our minds and find new perspectives. Remember, you'll figure out a solution to your wallet problem. But for now, let's keep playing and have some fun.
