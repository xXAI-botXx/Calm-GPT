Person A: Oh my gosh, I can't find my keys anywhere! I have to leave in 5 minutes and I can't be late!

Person B: Take a deep breath, it's going to be okay. Let's try to distract your mind for a moment. How about we play a game of "I Spy"?

Person A: I don't know, I'm really stressed right now. But I guess it can't hurt to try. Okay, let's do it.

Person B: Great! I'll start. I spy with my little eye something that is blue.

Person A: Hmm... Is it the pen on the table?

Person B: Nope, keep trying!

Person A: Is it the picture frame on the wall?

Person B: You got it! Well done! Your turn now.

Person A: Okay, I spy with my little eye something that is round.

Person B: Is it the clock on the wall?

Person A: Yes, you're right! Good job!

Person B: See, playing this game can help take your mind off the problem for a while. Let's keep playing until you feel a bit calmer.

Person A: That sounds like a good plan. Thank you for being here and helping me through this panic moment.

Person B: Of course, anytime! We'll find your keys eventually, but for now, let's have a little fun.
