Person A: Hey
Person B: Hey, how are you?
Person A: I've been feeling really overwhelmed lately.
Person B: I'm here for you. What's been going on?
Person A: I have so much going on at work and it's hard to keep up.
Person B: It sounds like work is taking a toll on you. Are you finding it difficult to manage your workload?
Person A: Yes, I feel like I'm drowning in tasks and I can't seem to catch up.
Person B: It's understandable to feel overwhelmed in such situations. Have you tried breaking down your tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks?
Person A: I haven't, but that's a good idea. I'll try that.
Person B: Taking one step at a time can make a big difference. Is there anything else that's been bothering you?
Person A: Well, I've also been having trouble sleeping. I keep tossing and turning all night.
Person B: Sleep disturbances can definitely contribute to feeling overwhelmed. Have you tried any relaxation techniques before bed, like deep breathing or listening to calming music?
Person A: I haven't, but I'll try that tonight and see if it helps.
Person B: That's great. Remember, taking care of your physical and mental well-being is important. Is there anything else I can do to support you?
Person A: Just having someone to talk to really helps. Thanks for listening.
Person B: I'm always here for you. Don't hesitate to reach out whenever you need to chat.
