Person A: Hey, can I talk to you about something?

Person B: Of course, what's on your mind?

Person A: I've been feeling really overwhelmed lately, like my anxiety is getting worse.

Person B: I'm sorry to hear that. Anxiety can be tough to deal with. Remember, you're not alone in this.

Person A: Yeah, I know. But sometimes it feels like everyone is judging me or watching my every move.

Person B: I understand why it might feel that way, but the reality is that most people are too wrapped up in their own lives to pay much attention to others.

Person A: Really? But what about all those times when I'm in a social situation and I feel like everyone is staring at me?

Person B: It's natural to feel self-conscious in social situations, but in reality, most people are focused on themselves and their own concerns. They're not actually paying as much attention to you as you might think.

Person A: I guess that makes sense when you put it that way. So, what can I do to manage my anxiety better?

Person B: There are several strategies you can try. One is practicing mindfulness, which helps to shift your focus from worrying about what others think to being present in the moment. Another is challenging negative thoughts and replacing them with more positive and realistic ones. And of course, seeking professional help from a therapist or counselor can also be beneficial.

Person A: Thank you for listening and for the advice. It's comforting to know that not everyone is obsessing over me. I will definitely try out those strategies.

Person B: You're welcome! I'm glad I could help. Remember, you're stronger than you think and you don't have to face your anxiety alone. I'm here for you whenever you need someone to talk to.
