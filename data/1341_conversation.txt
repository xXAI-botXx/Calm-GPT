Person A: Hey, are you there?
Person B: Yes, I'm here. What's going on?
Person A: I'm freaking out. I have so much to do and I don't know where to start.
Person B: Take a deep breath. Remember to be kind to yourself and take it one step at a time. What do you need to do?
Person A: I have a project deadline coming up and I haven't even started yet. I don't think I can finish it on time.
Person B: It's okay, don't panic. Break the project down into smaller tasks and prioritize them. Start with the most important one and work your way through. You've got this.
Person A: But what if I mess it up or it's not good enough?
Person B: Remember, you are capable and have done great work before. Trust in your abilities. Take breaks when you need them and ask for help if necessary. You'll do your best, and that's all that matters.
Person A: Thank you for being there for me. I needed that reassurance.
Person B: Of course, you're not alone in this. I believe in you. Remember to be kind to yourself along the way. You'll get through it.
