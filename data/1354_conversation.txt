Person A: Hey 
Person B: Hey, how are you? 
Person A: Not so great. I've been feeling really overwhelmed lately. 
Person B: I'm sorry to hear that. Is there something specific that's been weighing on you? 
Person A: Yeah, work has been really stressful and I feel like I can't keep up with everything. 
Person B: It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of pressure. Have you talked to your boss about how you're feeling? 
Person A: No, I haven't. I'm afraid they'll think I can't handle my job. 
Person B: It's understandable that you feel that way, but expressing your concerns to your boss might actually help. They may be able to offer support or find ways to alleviate some of the stress for you. 
Person A: You're right. I should have that conversation. Thanks for the advice. 
Person B: You're welcome. Remember, it's important to prioritize your mental well-being. Taking proactive steps to address your stress is a sign of strength, not weakness. 
Person A: I appreciate your support. It means a lot to me. 
Person B: I'm here for you. If you ever need someone to talk to or need further guidance, don't hesitate to reach out.
