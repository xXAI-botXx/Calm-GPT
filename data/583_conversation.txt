Patient: Hi, I'm here for my therapy session. 
Psychologist: Hello, welcome. How have you been since our last session? 
Patient: I've been feeling a bit overwhelmed lately. I've been experiencing a lot of anxiety. 
Psychologist: I understand that anxiety can be really difficult to deal with. Can you tell me more about what triggers your anxiety? 
Patient: It seems to come on whenever I have to speak in public or meet new people. I start to feel this tightness in my chest and my heart races. 
Psychologist: Those are common symptoms of anxiety. Have you noticed any patterns or specific situations where this happens? 
Patient: It mainly happens at work, during team meetings or presentations. It's gotten to a point where I avoid these situations as much as possible. 
Psychologist: Avoidance can provide temporary relief, but it can also reinforce the anxiety in the long run. Is there anything else that contributes to your anxiety? 
Patient: Yes, I also worry a lot about what others think of me. I'm constantly seeking approval and fear being judged or criticized. 
Psychologist: It sounds like you have a high level of self-consciousness, which can definitely contribute to anxiety. We can work on building your confidence and self-acceptance. 
Patient: That would be helpful. I'm tired of letting my anxiety control my life. What strategies can I use to manage my anxiety in these situations? 
Psychologist: We can start by exploring some relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing and mindfulness. It's also important to challenge any negative thoughts or beliefs you have about yourself. 
Patient: I'll give those techniques a try. Do you have any other suggestions for me? 
Psychologist: I would also encourage you to gradually expose yourself to the situations that trigger your anxiety, in a controlled and supportive environment. This can help you build up your tolerance and confidence over time. 
Patient: That makes sense. I'll do my best to overcome my anxiety. Thank you for your guidance and support. 
Psychologist: You're welcome. Remember that progress takes time and effort, but I believe in your ability to overcome this. Let's continue working together to help you live a more fulfilling life.
