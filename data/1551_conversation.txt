Person A: Hey
Person B: Hey, how are you?
Person A: I'm feeling really overwhelmed lately.
Person B: I see, what's been on your mind?
Person A: Work has been really stressful, and I've been struggling to keep up.
Person B: It sounds like you've been carrying a heavy load. Is there something specific at work that's been causing this stress?
Person A: Yeah, my boss has been constantly piling on new projects without considering my current workload.
Person B: That does sound challenging. Have you spoken to your boss about how you've been feeling?
Person A: Not yet, I've been hesitant to bring it up.
Person B: I understand your hesitation, but it's important to communicate your concerns. Your well-being matters. Maybe you can schedule a conversation with your boss to discuss your workload.
Person A: You're right, I should advocate for myself. I'll try to set up a meeting with my boss.
Person B: That's a great step forward. Remember, your mental health should never be compromised. Take care of yourself and don't hesitate to reach out if you need any more support.
Person A: Thank you, I appreciate your understanding and advice.
