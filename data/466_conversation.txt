Therapist: Good afternoon! How are you feeling today?
Patient: Hi, I'm feeling really overwhelmed. I have so much stress and anxiety right now.
Therapist: I understand that feeling, and I want you to remember that you're not alone in this. We can work through it together. 
Patient: I appreciate that, but sometimes it feels like there's no way out of this constant state of worry.
Therapist: It's completely normal to feel that way, but remember that even in the darkest of moments, there is always a glimmer of hope. Let's focus on that. 
Patient: I'll try, but it's just hard to see any light at the end of the tunnel right now.
Therapist: I know it may be tough, but I believe in your strength to overcome this. You are stronger than you think, and I have confidence in your ability to find your way out.
Patient: You really think so? I've been feeling so weak lately, like everything is just too much for me to handle.
Therapist: Absolutely! I see a resilient person in you, someone who has faced challenges before and emerged stronger. You have the power within you, and with a little support, you can regain your strength and resilience.
Patient: That's a comforting thought. It's just hard to remember that when I'm in the midst of all this stress. 
Therapist: I completely understand. But remember, this stress is temporary. One day, you will look back at this moment and be proud of how far you've come. You are capable of so much more than you realize right now.
Patient: Thank you for your faith in me. It means a lot, especially when I struggle to believe in myself.
Therapist: You're welcome! Just remember that I'm here for you every step of the way. Together, we will navigate through this storm and find a place of peace and happiness.
Patient: I can't express how grateful I am to have you as my therapist. Your positivity and support mean the world to me.
Therapist: It's my privilege to assist you on this journey. Let's keep pushing forward, one day at a time. You're doing great, and brighter days are ahead.
