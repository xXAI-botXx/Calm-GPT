Trusting this strange but comforting sensation, you step closer, dipping your toes in the water. The whirlpool responds, swirling even more intricately, and you feel an invisible hand guiding you to a small boat nearby.

User: Can I feel the boat?

Storyteller: Yes, absolutely. The boat is crafted from smooth, polished wood, with a cushioned seat and soft cushions for you to relax on. You climb into the boat, feeling the gentle rocking motion beneath you, as the whirlpool takes hold and starts to carry you on a magical journey.
