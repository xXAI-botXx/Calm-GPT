Person A: Hey
Person B: Hey, how are you feeling today?
Person A: Not so great... I've been feeling really overwhelmed lately.
Person B: I'm sorry to hear that. Is there something specific that's been causing the overwhelm?
Person A: Yeah, I've been having trouble managing my workload at work and it's been piling up.
Person B: That sounds like a lot to handle. Have you talked to your manager about it?
Person A: No, not yet. I guess I've been hesitant to bring it up.
Person B: It's important to communicate your struggles. Your manager might be able to offer support or help redistribute the workload. You don't have to face it alone.
Person A: You're right. I'll try to schedule a meeting with them this week.
Person B: That's a good step forward. Remember, it's okay to ask for help when you need it. Taking care of your mental well-being is important too.
Person A: Thank you for understanding and supporting me. It means a lot.
Person B: Of course, I'm here for you. Remember, you're not alone in this. Reach out whenever you need someone to talk to.
