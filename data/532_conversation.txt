Psychologist: I see. Has anything specific been triggering these feelings of anxiety?
Patient: Well, I've been under a lot of pressure at work, and I feel like I'm constantly falling behind. It's been overwhelming.
Psychologist: It sounds like work-related stress is a significant factor in your anxiety. Have you noticed any physical symptoms in addition to the racing heart and difficulty sleeping?
Patient: Yes, I've been experiencing stomachaches and headaches almost every day. It's been exhausting.
Psychologist: I want you to know that what you're feeling is valid, and we can work through this together. Let's start by discussing some coping mechanisms that could help you manage your anxiety.
Patient: That would be great. I'm open to any suggestions.
Psychologist: One technique that might benefit you is deep breathing exercises. Taking slow, deep breaths can help slow down your heart rate and bring a sense of calmness.
Patient: I'll give it a try. Are there any other techniques I could use when I feel overwhelmed?
