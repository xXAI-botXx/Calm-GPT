You can feel the soft grass beneath your feet as you start exploring the trail that leads you closer to the volcano. With each step, allow your body to relax and your mind to focus solely on this serene experience.

User: I can feel the tranquility enveloping me.

Let these gentle sounds lull you into a deep sense of calm and relaxation.

User: I'm fully immersed in this peaceful setting.
