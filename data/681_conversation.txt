User: Yes, they are a serene blend of white and soft pink, radiating tranquility.
Storyteller: Take a moment and picture yourself sitting near the pond, feeling the coolness of the water against your fingertips. As you sit there, you notice a dragonfly dancing gracefully in the air. Observe its iridescent wings shimmering in the sunlight. What colors do its wings possess?
