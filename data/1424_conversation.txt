Person A: I can't believe they did this to me! I am so angry right now!
Person B: I understand that you're feeling angry. It's important to acknowledge and validate your emotions. Can you tell me more about what happened?
Person A: They betrayed my trust. I thought they were my friends, but they stabbed me in the back!
Person B: That sounds really hurtful. It's completely normal to feel angry in this situation. How are you coping with your anger?
Person A: I've been trying to calm myself down, but it's not easy. I just can't believe they would do this!
Person B: It's okay to feel overwhelmed right now. Remember to take deep breaths and give yourself some time to process your emotions. How about we explore some healthy coping mechanisms together?
Person A: I guess I could try that. What do you suggest?
Person B: One technique you can try is progressive muscle relaxation. It involves tensing and then releasing various muscle groups in your body to help relieve tension. Would you like to give it a go?
Person A: Sure, anything that might help me calm down. How do I do it?
Person B: Start by clenching your fists tightly, then release. Focus on the sensation of the tension leaving your body. Now, let's move on to your shoulders. Shrug them up towards your ears, hold, and then release. Feel the tension melting away.
Person A: *follows the instructions* I do feel a little better already. Thank you for your help.
Person B: You're welcome. Remember, it's important to give yourself time and space to process your emotions. If you need someone to talk to, I'm here for you.
