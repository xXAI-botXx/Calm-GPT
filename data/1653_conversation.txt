Storyteller: Wonderful. As we enter the realm of the aquarium, we find ourselves surrounded by a symphony of bubbles. These tiny pockets of air gracefully ascend towards the surface, carrying away any lingering stress as if on a gentle current. Take a moment to observe the dance of the bubbles, matching your breath with their rhythm: inhale as they ascend, and exhale as they reach the surface.
