Person A: Oh no, I can't believe this is happening! I'm freaking out!
Person B: Hey, take a deep breath. I'm here for you. What's going on?
Person A: I just lost my job, and I have bills to pay. I don't know how I'm going to survive.
Person B: I understand you're scared right now, but let's not focus on the negative. Remember, you have skills and experience that will help you find a new job.
Person A: But what if I can't find another job? What if I end up homeless?
Person B: It's okay to have those concerns, but try to focus on what you have, not what you don't have. You have a support system, including me, who will help you through this tough time.
Person A: You're right. I do have people who care about me. I should be grateful for that.
Person B: Absolutely! And let's not forget about your health, friends, and other blessings in your life. Counting your blessings will help shift your perspective from fear to gratitude.
Person A: Thank you for reminding me of the positive things in my life. I needed that.
Person B: You're welcome! Remember, you're not alone. We'll get through this together.
