Therapist: Good morning, how are you feeling today? 
Patient: Oh, I'm just so stressed out and anxious. I can't seem to shake these feelings.

Therapist: It's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed, but you've already taken the first step by reaching out for help. That's a sign of strength. 
Patient: Thank you, but sometimes it feels like I'll never be able to find peace.

Therapist: I want you to know that these feelings are temporary. We will work together to find coping strategies that will bring you comfort and calmness. 
Patient: I appreciate that, but I feel like my stress just keeps piling up and I can't handle it all.

Therapist: Remember, you don't have to handle everything at once. Take one step at a time and prioritize what needs your attention. You are capable of finding balance. 
Patient: I'll try, but it's hard to even begin when everything feels so overwhelming.

Therapist: I can understand how it may seem daunting. Let's break things down into small manageable tasks. Each small success will build your confidence and help you conquer the bigger challenges. 
Patient: That makes sense. Maybe if I start with something small, I'll feel more in control of everything else.

Therapist: Exactly! And remember, you're not alone in this. I'll be here to support you every step of the way. We will get through this together. 
Patient: It's reassuring to know that I have your support. It already feels a little less heavy.

Therapist: That's great progress. Believe in your ability to overcome these obstacles, as you've already shown great resilience by seeking help. 
Patient: Thank you. I'm going to try my best and stay positive.

Therapist: That's the spirit! It won't always be easy, but by staying positive and focusing on solutions, you'll gradually find relief from the stress and anxiety. 
Patient: I'll keep that in mind and keep pushing forward. Thank you for your guidance and encouragement.

Therapist: You're welcome. Remember, progress may be slow, but it's still progress. Celebrate each step forward, no matter how small. You've got this! 
Patient: I appreciate your positivity and belief in me. I'll do my best to stay motivated.
