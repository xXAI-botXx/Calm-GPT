Person A: I'm feeling really panicked and scared right now.

Person B: Take a deep breath. Let's try something to distract your mind. Give me three random words.

Person A: Um, cat, beach, spaceship.

Person B: Alright. Imagine this: You're on a beautiful beach, the sand is warm between your toes, and the waves are gently crashing onto the shore. Suddenly, out of nowhere, a spaceship lands in the middle of the beach. But instead of aliens, it's filled with cats! Cats in cute little space suits, meowing and purring as they explore the beach. Can you see it?

Person A: (laughs) That's actually quite funny. I can picture it now.

Person B: See? Sometimes all it takes is a little imagination and humor to calm our anxieties. And remember, whenever you feel overwhelmed, just think of those space cats on the beach!

Person A: Thank you, that really did help.
