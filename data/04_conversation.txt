Person A: I’ve been feeling really anxious lately. It’s not just the usual stress, it’s something more. I think it’s related to my medical condition.

Person B: Oh, I’m sorry to hear that you’re feeling this way. Can you tell me more about what you’re experiencing?

Person A: Well, it’s like I’m constantly on edge. I have trouble sleeping, and I can’t seem to stop worrying about my health. It’s really affecting my daily life.

Person B: That sounds tough, but remember, it’s okay to feel this way. You’re dealing with a lot right now. Have you spoken to your doctor about these feelings?

Person A: Yes, I have. They said it could be Anxiety Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition. I’m starting therapy soon, but it’s just… overwhelming.

Person B: I can only imagine how challenging this must be for you. But it’s great that you’re seeking help and starting therapy. Remember, it’s okay to take things one step at a time. And don’t forget, you’re not alone in this. There are people who care about you and want to help.

Person A: Thank you, that means a lot. I’m trying to stay positive, but some days are harder than others.

Person B: Absolutely, and that’s perfectly okay. Remember, it’s okay to have bad days. Just try to take care of yourself, do things you enjoy, and reach out when you need support. You’re stronger than you think!

Person A: Thank you for your kind words and support. It really helps.

Person B: Anytime, my friend. Remember, you’re not alone in this. We’re here for you.
