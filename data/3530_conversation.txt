Storyteller: Ah, the tranquil realm of the zen garden. Imagine a beautiful sanctuary, filled with lush green plants, delicate flowers, and a sense of utter peace. The air is scented with the sweet fragrance of blossoming cherry trees, and the soothing sound of water trickling from a nearby bubbling fountain fills the air. It's a place where one can find calmness amidst the chaos of life.

Imagine vibrant pink lotus flowers floating gracefully in a serene pond, their petals glowing in the sunlight. The pond reflects the beauty of the surroundings, mirroring the azure sky and creating a sense of oneness with nature. You can sit by the pond and watch as koi fish gracefully swim beneath the surface, their scales shimmering in shades of orange, gold, and white.
