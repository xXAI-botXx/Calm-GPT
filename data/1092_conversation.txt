Person A: Hey 
Person B: Hey, how are you? 
Person A: Not great, I've been diagnosed with Acute Stress Disorder.
Person B: Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. What exactly does that mean? 
Person A: It's a reaction to a traumatic event, causing symptoms like anxiety, panic attacks, and flashbacks. 
Person B: That sounds really tough. Are you getting any professional help to manage it? 
Person A: Yeah, I'm seeing a therapist, but it's still really overwhelming at times. 
Person B: I can imagine. Are there any specific triggers that you've noticed? 
Person A: Loud noises and crowded places tend to make me really anxious. 
Person B: I see. Is there anything I can do to help when you're feeling overwhelmed? 
Person A: Just being there to listen and offer support means a lot to me. 
Person B: Of course, I'm here for you. Do you find any relaxation techniques helpful? 
Person A: Deep breathing and meditation have been quite helpful in calming me down. 
Person B: That's great to hear. Have you tried any grounding exercises? 
Person A: Not yet, but I'm open to suggestions. What kind of grounding exercises do you recommend? 
Person B: One simple exercise is to focus on your senses - notice five things you can see, four things you can touch, three things you can hear, two things you can smell, and one thing you can taste. It helps bring you back to the present moment. 
Person A: That sounds like a really good technique. I'll give it a try next time I feel overwhelmed. 
Person B: That's awesome. Remember, you're not alone in this. I'm here to support you every step of the way.
