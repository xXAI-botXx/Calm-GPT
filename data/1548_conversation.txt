Person B: Hey, how are you?
Person A: Ugh, not great. I've been dealing with Substance/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder lately.
Person B: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. What exactly is Substance/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder?
Person A: It's a condition where anxiety symptoms are caused by drugs or medication. It's really frustrating.
Person B: I can imagine. Are there any specific triggers for your anxiety?
Person A: Well, it seems to happen whenever I take certain medications or substances, like caffeine.
Person B: Have you talked to your doctor about it? They might be able to suggest alternative medications or ways to manage the anxiety.
Person A: I haven't yet, but that's a good idea. I should definitely make an appointment.
Person B: Definitely! It's important to have professional guidance. In the meantime, have you tried any self-care techniques to help calm your anxiety?
Person A: I've been practicing deep breathing exercises and trying to incorporate meditation into my daily routine.
Person B: That's excellent! Deep breathing and meditation can be really helpful in reducing anxiety. Keep it up!
Person A: Thanks, I'll try my best. It's just been challenging lately.
Person B: I understand, but don't forget that you're strong and capable of overcoming this. Remember to be kind to yourself and give yourself credit for every effort you make to manage your anxiety.
Person A: That means a lot, thank you for your support. I'll keep pushing forward.
Person B: Absolutely! You're not alone in this. If you ever need someone to talk to or have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out. You're doing great!
