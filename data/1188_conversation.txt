Person A: Hey 
Person B: Hey, how are you? 
Person A: I'm feeling really anxious and scared right now. 
Person B: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me what's been going on? 
Person A: I have a big presentation at work tomorrow and I'm afraid I'll mess it up. 
Person B: I understand how you feel, but remember that you are capable and have prepared for this. You got this! 
Person A: I don't know, what if I freeze up or forget everything? 
Person B: Let me tell you a little story to distract you. Once upon a time, there was a little turtle who was afraid to come out of his shell. But one day, he gathered up all his courage and stepped out into the open. And you know what? He discovered a beautiful world waiting for him. Just like that turtle, you might have some fears, but I believe in you and your ability to overcome them. 
Person A: That's a nice story. Thank you for sharing it with me. 
Person B: You're welcome! Remember, you have all the qualities needed to succeed. Take a deep breath, visualize yourself giving a fantastic presentation, and trust in your abilities. You've got this!
