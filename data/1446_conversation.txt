Person A: Hey
Person B: Hey, how are you?
Person A: I'm feeling really overwhelmed lately.
Person B: I'm here for you. What's been going on?
Person A: I've been juggling so many things at once and I feel like I can't handle it all.
Person B: It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of pressure. Can you identify specific tasks or responsibilities that are causing this overwhelm?
Person A: Well, work has been extremely demanding lately and I also have personal obligations to fulfill.
Person B: It's understandable to feel overwhelmed when you have a lot on your plate. Is there anything you can delegate or ask for help with at work or in your personal life?
Person A: I guess I could try asking for assistance, but I hate feeling like I'm burdening others.
Person B: Remember, it's okay to ask for help. People are often willing to lend a hand when you're feeling overwhelmed. It's important to take care of yourself too.
Person A: You're right, I should reach out and ask for support. Thanks for reminding me of that.
Person B: You're welcome. Just remember that you're not alone in this, and it's completely normal to feel overwhelmed at times. Prioritizing self-care and seeking assistance can make a big difference.
