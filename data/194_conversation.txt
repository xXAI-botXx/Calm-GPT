Person A: Oh my gosh, I can't breathe! I'm freaking out! 
Person B: Take a deep breath and tell me what's going on. What are you afraid of? 
Person A: I have this big presentation at work tomorrow, and I'm terrified of public speaking. 
Person B: Ah, I understand. Public speaking can be nerve-wracking for many people. But you know what? Let's look at it from a different angle. 
Person A: What do you mean? 
Person B: Well, imagine you're giving this presentation, and suddenly, everyone in the room turns into adorable puppies. Just picture it, a room full of wagging tails and wet noses! 
Person A: Haha, that's ridiculous! But it's actually making me smile. 
Person B: Exactly! Laughter is a great way to release tension. Now, let's practice your presentation with this new puppy-filled perspective in mind.
