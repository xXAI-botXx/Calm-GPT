Vibrant parrots flutter above you, their feathers an array of colors as they dance through the emerald canopy. The trees provide comforting shade, allowing beams of sunlight to filter through in a calming, dappled pattern.

Storyteller: It truly is! As you venture deeper into the jungle, you notice a clearing up ahead. The moment you step into it, you are transported back in time to a prehistoric world. Massive ferns tower over you, and ancient trees create a natural canopy, shielding you from the outside world. You've arrived at the heart of Dinosaur Island.
