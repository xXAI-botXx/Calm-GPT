Person A: Hey, I'm feeling really anxious about the future.
Person B: Hey, I understand. Remember to breathe. Everything will be fine.
Person A: I can't stop worrying. What if things don't work out?
Person B: It's natural to have those thoughts, but try not to focus on them too much. Accept the feeling instead of fighting it.
Person A: But what if I can't handle it? What if I fail?
Person B: Take a deep breath. You're stronger than you think. It's okay to have doubts, but don't let them consume you. Trust yourself.
Person A: I don't know if I can. I feel so overwhelmed.
Person B: It's normal to feel overwhelmed at times. Just take it one step at a time. You don't have to figure it all out right now.
Person A: I wish I could stop worrying about the future.
Person B: Remember, worrying won't change anything. Focus on the present, and trust that things will work out in the end. It may not be easy, but it will get better.
Person A: I'll try my best. Thanks for being there.
Person B: You're welcome. Remember, I'm here to support you, and you're not alone in this. We'll get through it together.
