User: Rainbow.

Storyteller: Ah, the beauty of rainbows! Have you ever wondered where they come from?

User: Where do they come from?

Storyteller: Well, imagine a gentle rain falling from the sky, near the edges of a serene meadow. The sun starts to peek out from behind the clouds, casting its warm rays upon the raindrops.

User: The raindrops glisten in the sunlight.

Storyteller: Yes, they do! As the sunlight passes through each tiny raindrop, it transforms into a prism. Inside that prism, the sunlight splits into all the colors of the rainbow – red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet.

User: The colors blend together beautifully.

Storyteller: Indeed, they do! Now, imagine that each color of the rainbow holds a specific quality, bringing forth unique feelings and sensations. Let us travel along the rainbow together, shall we?
