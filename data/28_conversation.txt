Person A: Hey, I've been feeling quite down lately, and I can't seem to shake off my worries. 
Person B: I'm sorry to hear that. Is there anything specific that's been bothering you? 
Person A: Well, I've been stressing about my upcoming job interview. I feel like I'm not prepared enough and that I might mess it up. 
Person B: I understand how nerve-wracking job interviews can be. How about we try to distract you with a creative task? It might help take your mind off things. 
Person A: That sounds like a good idea. What do you have in mind? 
Person B: How about we start a collaborative art project? We can each create a piece of artwork that represents our feelings, using any medium we prefer. It can be painting, drawing, or even weaving. 
Person A: That actually sounds like a fun and therapeutic way to channel my energy. Count me in! 
Person B: Great! Let's set a time to work on our art pieces together, and maybe we can even have a mini art exhibition afterwards to showcase our creations. 
Person A: That sounds amazing! It'll be a nice distraction, and who knows, it might even boost my confidence for the interview. Thanks for suggesting this creative activity, it means a lot to me. 
Person B: You're welcome! I'm glad I could help. Remember, you've got this, and no matter the outcome of the interview, your talent is undeniable. Let's focus on the art and enjoy the process.
