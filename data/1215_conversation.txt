Person A: Hey, are you there?
Person B: Yes, I'm here. What's going on?
Person A: I'm feeling really panicky right now. I can't seem to calm down.
Person B: Take a deep breath. Inhale slowly, and then exhale. Repeat this a few times to help regulate your breathing.
Person A: Okay, I'll try that. *deep breath* It's helping a bit.
Person B: That's great! Remember, you're not alone. I'm here to support you.
Person A: Thank you, I appreciate that. But I still feel so overwhelmed.
Person B: It's normal to feel overwhelmed in moments like these. Let's focus on something positive. Is there anything that brings you joy or makes you feel calm?
Person A: Well, I love spending time in nature. It always helps me relax.
Person B: That's a great idea. Maybe you can go for a walk or find a quiet spot outside where you can connect with nature for a while.
Person A: That sounds like a good plan. I'll give it a try.
Person B: Remember, you're strong and capable of managing this panic. Stay positive and know that you will get through it.
Person A: Thank you for your support. I'll let you know how it goes.
Person B: I'll be here for you. Take care and remember to take things one step at a time.
