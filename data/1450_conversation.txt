Person A: Hey
Person B: Hey, how are you?
Person A: I'm feeling really panicked right now. I lost my wallet and I don't have any identification or money.
Person B: Oh no! That sounds really stressful. How about I tell you a story to take your mind off things? Once upon a time, there was a brave adventurer who found themselves in a similar situation...
Person A: That sounds nice. Please go on.
Person B: This adventurer realized that they had lost their wallet while exploring a magical forest. But instead of panicking, they decided to use their survival skills and resourcefulness to find a solution. They knew that there were friendly animals in the forest who could help them. 
Person A: That's interesting. What did the adventurer do next?
Person B: Well, they came across a wise owl who offered to guide them to a hidden treasure that could help them replace their lost items. The owl led them to a secret cave where they found a chest filled with money and a magical identification card that could never be lost!
Person A: Wow, that's amazing! I wish I had a wise owl to help me right now.
Person B: Maybe there's a metaphorical wise owl in your life, someone who can offer guidance and support. Or maybe, just like the adventurer, you can tap into your own inner strength and find creative solutions to your problem. Remember, everything is possible!
Person A: You're right. I shouldn't let this situation bring me down. Thank you for sharing the story, it really helped to distract and uplift me.
Person B: I'm glad it could bring a smile to your face. Just remember, no matter what life throws at you, there's always a way to overcome it. You've got this!
