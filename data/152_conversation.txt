Person A: I'm feeling so anxious about the future. I can't stop worrying about what will happen.

Person B: Take a deep breath and try to calm down. Everything will be fine, I promise.

Person A: But how can I just accept this feeling? It's consuming me!

Person B: I know it's difficult, but sometimes we can't control our emotions. Just know that this feeling won't last forever. It will pass, and you will feel better soon.

Person A: I wish I could do something about it now. I hate feeling like this.

Person B: It's completely understandable, but remember that you're human. You can't always have control over your emotions. All you can do right now is accept it and allow yourself to experience it. It will make it easier for you to move forward.

Person A: I suppose you're right. I need to stop fighting against it and just sit with this feeling for a while.

Person B: That's it. Sometimes, by accepting our emotions, we can find some peace within ourselves. Just remember that this feeling is temporary and you have the strength to get through it.

Person A: Thank you for being here and helping me through this. It means a lot to me.

Person B: You're welcome. Remember, I'm here for you. You're not alone in this, and things will get better.
