Person A: Hey
Person B: Hey, how are you?
Person A: I'm feeling really overwhelmed lately.
Person B: I understand. Can you tell me more about what's been going on?
Person A: Well, I've been dealing with a lot of stress at work and it's been affecting my sleep and appetite.
Person B: I see. It sounds like work has been taking a toll on your overall well-being. Have you talked to anyone about it?
Person A: Not really, I've been trying to handle it on my own.
Person B: Sometimes it can be helpful to speak with someone who can offer support and guidance. Have you considered reaching out to a therapist or counselor?
Person A: I haven't really thought about it, but maybe it could be a good idea.
Person B: If you're open to it, I can help you find some resources in your area. It's important to prioritize your mental health and seek help when needed.
Person A: That would be great, thank you. I feel like I could use some professional guidance to help me navigate through this.
Person B: You're welcome. Remember, seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness. I'm here for you and we'll find the support you need.
