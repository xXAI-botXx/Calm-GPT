User: *deep breath* It smells divine! Like a garden in full bloom.

Storyteller: Now, let your gaze wander upwards. The sky is painted in a breathtaking array of colors – shades of pink, purple, and gold. As you watch, tiny stars start to twinkle, lighting up the heavens with their celestial glow. Let your worries drift away with each twinkling star.

User: It feels so peaceful here, like all my stress is melting away.
