Person A: I'm feeling really overwhelmed lately. There's just so much going on in my life and I don't know how to handle it all.

Person B: I understand how you feel. It's completely normal to feel overwhelmed from time to time. Let's try to focus on the positive aspects of your life to help you get through this. 

Person A: I appreciate that, but it's hard to see the positive right now. Everything seems to be going wrong and I don't know how to turn it around.

Person B: I understand that it may seem that way, but remember that difficult times often lead to personal growth and opportunities for change.  Can you think of anything positive that has happened recently, even if it's something small?

Person A: Well, I did manage to finish a project at work that I had been struggling with for weeks. It felt really good to finally accomplish that.

Person B: That's great! Recognize and celebrate your achievements, no matter how small they may seem. It's important to remind yourself that you are capable of overcoming challenges. 

Person A: You're right, I need to give myself more credit for what I have accomplished. I guess I've been so focused on what's going wrong that I haven't noticed the things I've achieved.

Person B: Absolutely, sometimes we tend to dwell on the negatives and overlook our own successes. Remember that you have the ability to handle whatever comes your way, and there are always positive aspects to focus on. 

Person A: Thank you for helping me shift my perspective. I feel better already, knowing that I can choose to concentrate on the positive things in my life.

Person B: You're welcome! Just remember to take things one step at a time and be kind to yourself. You've got this, and I'm here to support you along the way.
