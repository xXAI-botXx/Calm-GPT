Person B: Hey, how are you?
Person A: I'm feeling really overwhelmed lately.
Person B: What's been going on that's making you feel overwhelmed?
Person A: Work has been really stressful and I've been having trouble keeping up with everything.
Person B: It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of pressure. Have you talked to your boss about how you're feeling?
Person A: Not yet. I've been hesitant to bring it up; I don't want to seem incapable.
Person B: It's important to communicate your needs and concerns. Your boss may be more understanding than you think. Remember, asking for help isn't a sign of weakness.
Person A: You're right. I should reach out to my boss and share what I've been going through.
Person B: That's a great step to take. Additionally, make sure to set aside some time for self-care. It's important to recharge and take care of your mental well-being.
Person A: I haven't been prioritizing self-care lately. I'll try to make time for it.
Person B: Taking care of yourself should be a priority. It's okay to take breaks and focus on your own needs. Remember, you can't pour from an empty cup.
Person A: Thank you for reminding me of that. I'll make sure to make self-care a regular part of my routine.
