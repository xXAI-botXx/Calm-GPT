Person A: Hey, I'm feeling really anxious and stressed lately.

Person B: Oh no, what's been bothering you?

Person A: Well, I have so many deadlines at work and I just can't seem to catch a break.

Person B: I totally get that. How about we take a little break to do something fun and creative to distract you? How about we make some origami animals?

Person A: That sounds interesting. I've never done origami before, but I'm willing to give it a try.

Person B: Great! Let's start with something simple. Fold a square piece of paper into a triangle by bringing two opposite corners together.

Person A: Okay, done. What's next?

Person B: Now, fold the triangle in half by bringing the bottom point up to meet the top point.

Person A: Like this?

Person B: Perfect! Now unfold it back to a triangle. Flip it over and fold the two bottom corners towards the top point, creating a smaller triangle.

Person A: Got it. What's next?

Person B: Now, fold the left and right sides of the triangle towards the center, creating a diamond shape.

Person A: Alright, done.

Person B: Now, fold the bottom tip of the diamond upwards, leaving a small triangle sticking out.

Person A: Okay, done. What should I do next?

Person B: Now, grab the two top corners and fold them down towards the bottom tip, aligning the edges to create the head of your origami animal.

Person A: I see, it's starting to take shape. What's the final step?

Person B: Lastly, fold the two bottom corners upwards, creating the legs of your origami animal.

Person A: Done! I can't believe I made this cute little origami animal. This was really fun and it definitely took my mind off my worries for a while.

Person B: I'm glad you enjoyed it! Sometimes taking a break and doing something creative can really help ease your mind. Keep practicing and soon you'll be able to make even more intricate origami designs.

Person A: Thank you for suggesting this activity. It really made a difference.
