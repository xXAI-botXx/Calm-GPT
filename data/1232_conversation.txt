Person A: Hey
Person B: Hey, how are you?
Person A: Not so great, to be honest.
Person B: I'm here for you. What's been going on?
Person A: I've been feeling really overwhelmed with work lately.
Person B: It sounds like you're feeling a lot of pressure. Can you tell me more about what's been overwhelming you?
Person A: Well, I have so many deadlines and it feels like there's never enough time to get everything done.
Person B: I can understand how that can be stressful. Have you tried breaking down your workload into smaller, more manageable tasks?
Person A: I haven't really thought about it that way. Maybe that would help.
Person B: It's worth a try. Sometimes when we're overwhelmed, it can be helpful to take a step back and tackle things one by one. That way, it doesn't feel as daunting.
Person A: That makes sense. I'll give it a shot.
Person B: Remember, it's important to take care of yourself too. Make sure you're getting enough rest and taking breaks when needed.
Person A: Thank you. I needed to hear that.
Person B: You're welcome. I'm always here to lend an ear and offer support.
