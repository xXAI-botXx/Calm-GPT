User: Candy Island.

Storyteller: Ah, Candy Island, a place where dreams come true and worries melt away. Picture yourself standing on a beach made entirely of powdered sugar, with soft waves of melted caramel gently lapping at your toes. Take a deep breath and let the sweetness fill your senses. What do you see around you?
