Patient: Good morning, Doctor. 

Psychologist: Good morning. How can I help you today? 

Patient: I've been feeling really down lately. I just don't have any motivation or energy to do anything. 

Psychologist: I'm sorry to hear that. When did you start feeling this way? 

Patient: I would say it started about a month ago. I've been having trouble sleeping as well. 

Psychologist: Has anything significant happened in your life before these feelings started? 

Patient: Well, I lost my job a few months ago, and I've been having difficulty finding a new one. That's been causing a lot of stress for me. 

Psychologist: I see. Losing a job can definitely be a stressful experience. How have you been coping with this stress? 

Patient: I've been isolating myself from friends and family, and I've stopped doing things I used to enjoy. I just feel like I don't have any purpose anymore. 

Psychologist: It's important to have a support system during difficult times. Is there anyone you can reach out to for support? 

Patient: I guess I could talk to my close friend. She's always been there for me. 

Psychologist: That's a good start. It's also important to take care of your physical health. Have you been eating well and exercising regularly? 

Patient: No, I haven't really had the motivation to take care of myself in that way either. 

Psychologist: Taking care of your physical health can have a positive impact on your mental health as well. I encourage you to try incorporating some healthy habits into your routine. 

Patient: I'll try my best. Thank you, Doctor. 

Psychologist: You're welcome. Remember, you're not alone in this. We can work together to help you feel better.
