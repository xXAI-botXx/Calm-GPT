Person A: Oh no, I can't find my keys anywhere! I need them to leave for work in 10 minutes and now I'm starting to panic.

Person B: Don't worry, I can help calm you down. Let's play a game to distract you from your stress. How about a round of "I Spy"?

Person A: I don't know, I'm really anxious about finding my keys. Will playing a game really help?

Person B: Trust me, it will help take your mind off things for a moment. Just give it a try. I'll start. "I spy with my little eye something that is yellow."

Person A: Okay, I'll play along. Is it a banana?

Person B: Nope, not a banana. Try again.

Person A: Is it a flower?

Person B: Close, but not exactly. Think smaller.

Person A: A lemon?

Person B: That's it! You got it. Now you give it a try. "I spy with my little eye something that is blue."

Person A: Hmm, is it the sky?

Person B: Nope, keep guessing.

Person A: Is it your shirt?

Person B: Almost there, but it's not my shirt.

Person A: Is it a blue pen?

Person B: Yes, you got it! See how much fun this game can be? It helps take your mind off the stress and gives you something else to focus on.

Person A: Wow, you're right. I actually feel a bit calmer now. Thanks for suggesting this game, it really helped distract me.

Person B: You're welcome! Remember, sometimes a little diversion can go a long way in relieving stress. Now, let's see if we can find your keys together.
