Person A: I can't believe this! I am so angry right now!

Person B: I understand that you're feeling angry. It's okay to feel this way. Can you tell me what has happened?

Person A: I had an argument with my best friend today. They said some really hurtful things to me.

Person B: It sounds like their words have deeply affected you. It's important to remember that you are valuable and deserving of respect.

Person A: I just can't stop thinking about the things they said. I feel betrayed and hurt.

Person B: I hear you. It's completely normal to feel that way when someone close to us says hurtful things. Remember, their words are a reflection of their own emotions, not necessarily your worth as a person.

Person A: I just feel so alone right now. I don't know if I can trust them anymore.

Person B: Feeling alone is tough, but remember that you are not alone. You have people who care about you, including myself. Trust is something that can be rebuilt over time if both parties are willing to work on it.

Person A: I appreciate your support. It means a lot to me. I just don't know how to move forward from this.

Person B: It's understandable that you're struggling with this right now. Maybe it would be helpful for you to take some time for yourself, engage in activities that bring you joy, and eventually have an open and honest conversation with your friend when you feel ready.

Person A: That sounds like a good idea. Thank you for being there for me and offering your guidance.

Person B: You're welcome. Remember, I'm here for you anytime you need someone to talk to. Take care of yourself and remember your worth.
