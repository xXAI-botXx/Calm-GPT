Person A: Oh my gosh, I can't believe this is happening! I'm in such a panic right now!

Person B: Hey, calm down. Take a deep breath. What's the matter?

Person A: I just found out that my flight got canceled, and I have no idea how to get back home!

Person B: Okay, I understand that it's a frustrating situation. But let's try to take your mind off it for a moment. How about we play a game?

Person A: Play a game? Now? I mean, sure, why not. What kind of game?

Person B: Let's play a word association game. I'll say a word, and you have to respond with the first word that comes to your mind. Ready?

Person A: Alright, I'll try to play along. Go ahead.

Person B: Sunshine.

Person A: Beach.

Person B: Waves.

Person A: Surfing.

Person B: Ocean.

Person A: Fish.

Person B: Coral.

Person A: Beautiful.

Person B: Nature.

Person B: Forest.

Person A: Adventure.

Person B: Exploration.

Person A: Discover.

Person B: New.

Person A: Hope.

Person B: Happiness.

Person A: Alright, I have to admit, that game actually helped me to momentarily forget about my canceled flight. Thanks for trying to distract me.

Person B: You're welcome. Sometimes a little distraction can work wonders. Just remember, there are always alternative solutions to problems, and things tend to work out in the end.

Person A: I'll keep that in mind. Thanks again for being there and helping me calm down.
