Person A: Hey
Person B: Hey, how are you?
Person A: I'm feeling really overwhelmed lately.
Person B: I understand. What has been causing the overwhelm?
Person A: I have so many responsibilities at work and I feel like I can't keep up.
Person B: It sounds like you're under a lot of pressure. Have you tried talking to your supervisor about it?
Person A: No, I haven't. I'm afraid they'll think I can't handle the workload.
Person B: It's important to communicate your concerns. Your supervisor might be able to offer support or make adjustments to help ease the pressure. Have you considered discussing it with them?
Person A: I guess you're right. I'll give it a shot and see how it goes.
Person B: That's a great step. Remember, it's okay to ask for help when we need it. You're not alone in this.
Person A: Thank you, I really needed to hear that. I'll reach out to my supervisor and see if we can find a solution together.
Person B: You're welcome. Remember to take care of yourself as well. It's important to prioritize self-care during stressful times. Let me know how it goes with your supervisor.
Person A: Sure, I'll keep you updated. Thanks again for your support.
Person B: Anytime. I'm here for you.
