Patient: Good morning, Dr. Smith. It's nice to see you again.
Psychologist: Good morning, John. How have you been since our last session?
Patient: I've been okay, but I've been feeling really overwhelmed lately. I've been struggling with anxiety and it's been affecting my sleep.
Psychologist: I'm sorry to hear that, John. Could you tell me more about what has been causing this anxiety?
Patient: Well, I've been having a lot of stress at work lately. The workload has been increasing and there's constant pressure to meet deadlines. It's been keeping me up at night, worrying about whether I can handle it all.
Psychologist: I can understand how that could be overwhelming. Have you been able to talk to your supervisor or seek support from colleagues?
Patient: I haven't yet, but I will consider doing that. I guess I've been hesitant to ask for help because I don't want to seem incapable or burden others with my problems.
Psychologist: It's important to remember that seeking help doesn't mean you're incapable. It actually takes a lot of strength to recognize when you need support. Talking to your supervisor or a trusted colleague might provide some solutions or at least alleviate some of the pressure.
Patient: You're right, I need to change my mindset about asking for help. I'll try reaching out to someone today. 
Psychologist: That's a positive step, John. In addition to that, I also recommend practicing some relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing or meditation, to help manage your anxiety. It's important to take care of yourself both mentally and physically.
Patient: Thank you, Dr. Smith. I appreciate your guidance and I'll definitely try those techniques. 
Psychologist: You're welcome, John. Remember, I'm here to support you throughout this process. Our next session is in two weeks, but feel free to reach out if you need anything before then. Take care of yourself.
Patient: Thank you, Dr. Smith. I will. See you in two weeks. Goodbye for now. 
Psychologist: Goodbye, John. Take care.
