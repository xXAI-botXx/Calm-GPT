Person A: Hey, are you there? I need help!

Person B: Hey, what's wrong? Take a deep breath and tell me what's going on.

Person A: I'm freaking out! I lost my wallet and I don't know what to do!

Person B: I understand how stressful that can be. Can you think of the last place you had it?

Person A: I'm not sure, I've been all over the place today.

Person B: Okay, let's take a step back. Why don't you try retracing your steps in your mind? Maybe that will jog your memory.

Person A: Okay, I was at the coffee shop, then I went to the grocery store, and after that, I had lunch downtown.

Person B: Great! Start by calling each of those places and asking if anyone has turned in a lost wallet. That could be a good first step.

Person A: Alright, I'll give it a try. Thanks for the suggestion!

Person B: No problem! Remember to stay calm and take it one step at a time. I'm here to support you.

Person A: I really appreciate it. I'll let you know how it goes.

Person B: Sounds good. Good luck, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything else!
