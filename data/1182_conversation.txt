Person A: Hey 
Person B: Hey, how are you? 
Person A: I'm feeling really frustrated. I've been dealing with discrimination lately. 
Person B: Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. What happened? 
Person A: I was denied a job opportunity because of my ethnicity. It's so unfair. 
Person B: That's terrible. Discrimination has no place in our society. Have you reported it? 
Person A: Yes, I filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. 
Person B: Good for you! That's an important step. Hopefully, it leads to some action. 
Person A: I hope so too, but it just feels so discouraging sometimes. 
Person B: I understand. It can be really tough, but remember that you're not alone in this. 
Person A: Thanks, I appreciate your support. It means a lot to me. 
Person B: Of course! We all need to stand together against discrimination. Is there anything else I can do to help? 
Person A: Just knowing that you're here to listen and offer support is enough. Thank you. 
Person B: No problem at all. I'm here for you, anytime you need to talk or vent. 
Person A: That means a lot to me. Thank you for being so positive and understanding. 
Person B: You're welcome! Stay strong and remember that you deserve equality and respect.
