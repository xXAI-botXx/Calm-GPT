Person A: Hey 
Person B: Hey, how are you? 
Person A: I'm feeling really overwhelmed lately. I have Separation Anxiety Disorder and it's been really tough. 
Person B: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about it? 
Person A: It's a condition where I feel intense fear and anxiety when I'm away from certain people or places. It's been interfering with my daily life. 
Person B: That sounds really challenging. Have you tried any strategies to cope with it? 
Person A: I've been going to therapy and working on relaxation techniques, but it's still a struggle. 
Person B: That's great that you're seeking help. Are there any specific situations that trigger your anxiety? 
Person A: Anytime I have to be alone or when I'm separated from my loved ones for even a short period of time. It can be really tough. 
Person B: I understand. Is there anything I can do to support you during those times? 
Person A: Honestly, your presence and understanding mean a lot to me. Just knowing that someone cares makes a difference. 
Person B: Of course, I'm here for you. If you ever need someone to talk to or if there's anything specific I can do, please let me know. 
Person A: Thank you so much for your offer. It means a lot to me. 
Person B: You're welcome! Remember, you're not alone in this journey. We'll work through it together.
