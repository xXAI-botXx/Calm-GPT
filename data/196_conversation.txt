Patient: Good morning, Doctor. I hope you're doing well today.

Psychologist: Good morning, how can I help you today?

Patient: Well, I've been feeling really down lately. I constantly have this feeling of sadness and lack of motivation.

Psychologist: I understand. Can you tell me more about what might have triggered these feelings?

Patient: I think it started after I lost my job. I've been feeling worthless and uncertain about my future.

Psychologist: Losing a job can be a challenging experience, and it's normal to feel a range of emotions. Have you been taking any steps to find new opportunities?

Patient: Yes, I've been actively searching for a new job, but the rejections have been really hard to handle.

Psychologist: Rejections can be tough, but it's important not to take them personally. Remember, each rejection brings you closer to finding the right opportunity. Have you been able to reach out for support from friends or family during this time?

Patient: I haven't really shared much with them, as I don't want to burden them with my problems.

Psychologist: It's understandable to feel that way, but sharing your feelings with loved ones can provide comfort and support. They might be more understanding than you think. Would you like some guidance on how to start those conversations?

Patient: That would be helpful. I just don't want to be a burden on them, you know?

Psychologist: I understand your concerns, but it's important to remember that opening up to others can actually strengthen your relationships. Perhaps you can start by expressing how you've been feeling and letting them know that you appreciate their support.

Patient: I will give it a try. Thank you, Doctor.

Psychologist: You're welcome. Remember, seeking help and support is a sign of strength, not weakness. I'm here for you, and together we can work towards finding healthier coping strategies.

Patient: I appreciate your support, Doctor.
