As you walk, focus on your breathing. Breathe in deeply as you take a step, and exhale any tension you may have been holding onto as you take the next one.

User: I'm breathing deeply and exhaling the tension away.

Storyteller: Very good. As you continue across the Rainbow Bridge, let your eyes follow the arc of colors above you.

As you walk through each color, allow yourself to immerse into that positive quality.
