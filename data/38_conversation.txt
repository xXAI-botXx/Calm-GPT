Person A: You know, I've been struggling with this Substance/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder lately, and it's been really difficult for me.

Person B: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. I didn't know you were going through this. Can you tell me a bit more about it? I'm here to listen.

Person B: That must be really tough for you. How have you been coping with it so far?

Person A: I've been trying different relaxation techniques, like deep breathing and meditation, but it's a constant struggle. I just can't seem to shake off the anxious feelings.

Person B: I can only imagine how frustrating that can be. Have you considered seeking professional help, like speaking to a therapist or a doctor?
