User: Forest clearing.
Storyteller: Ah, a forest clearing, a serene and magical place. Imagine walking into the depths of a lush green forest, the air fragrant with the scent of pine and earth. As you follow a narrow winding path, you come across a small clearing dappled with sunlight. The sound of rustling leaves and chirping birds surrounds you. What do you notice next?
