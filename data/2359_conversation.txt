The cottage is made of weathered wood, mossy and adorned with delicate vines that seem to embrace it. The windows are small and decorated with colorful stained glass, casting a warm glow from within.

As you enter, you're greeted by the flickering light of a crackling fire in a stone hearth. The room is cozy, with comfortable cushions and a soft rug on the floor. You can hear the gentle crackling of the fire and the occasional hoot of an owl in the distance.

User: What else is inside the cottage?

There is a small kitchen area, where dried herbs hang from the ceiling. The aroma of lavender, rosemary, and sage fills the air, making you feel instantly at peace.

User: Is there a garden outside?
Storyteller: Oh, indeed, there is a magical garden. Stepping outside, you find yourself surrounded by a lush paradise. Tall sunflowers sway in the gentle breeze, while vibrant butterflies dance from flower to flower. Bees hum a melodic tune as they collect nectar for their honey. In the center of the garden, there is a stone bench under a canopy of roses, inviting you to sit and breathe in the intoxicating scent of nature.

Storyteller: As you settle onto the stone bench, a soft rustling catches your attention. Turning your head, you see a family of deer grazing by a bubbling brook. They pause for a moment, as if acknowledging your presence, before continuing their peaceful feast. Squirrels scurry playfully along the branches, and birds sing melodious tunes from the treetops. You feel a sense of connection with these gentle creatures, as if the harmony of nature has embraced you.
