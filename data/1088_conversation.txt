Person A: Hi there.
Person B: Hey, how's it going?
Person A: I'm struggling a bit with my Body Dysmorphic Disorder today.
Person B: I'm sorry to hear that. What's been going on?
Person A: I can't stop obsessing over every little flaw in my appearance. It's really getting to me.
Person B: I understand how that feels. It can be tough to not get caught up in those thoughts. What are you specifically feeling self-conscious about today?
Person A: Mostly my nose. I feel like it's too big and everyone notices it.
Person B: It's understandable that you have those thoughts, but remember that people are usually more focused on their own lives than on our appearances. Have you spoken to anyone about these concerns?
Person A: Not really, I'm scared they'll think I'm being silly.
Person B: I can assure you that your concerns are not silly at all. But it might be helpful to confide in someone you trust, like a close friend or family member. They can provide support and reassurance.
Person A: I suppose you're right. I'll try reaching out to someone. Thanks for listening.
Person B: Of course! I'm here for you. Remember to be kind to yourself and try to practice some self-care to help manage those negative thoughts. You're stronger than you think!
Person A: Thank you, I needed to hear that.
