Person A: I can't find my keys anywhere! I'm starting to panic!
Person B: Take a deep breath and try to calm down. Remember, panicking won't help us find the keys.
Person A: But I need them urgently! I don't know what to do!
Person B: Let's think through the last time you remember having the keys. Have you checked all the usual places?
Person A: Yes, I've looked everywhere! They're just nowhere to be found.
Person B: Okay, let's try retracing your steps. When was the last time you used them?
Person A: I used them this morning when I left the house.
Person B: Did you put them back in your bag or in a specific place?
Person A: I'm not sure. I think I might have left them on the kitchen counter.
Person B: Alright, let's go check the kitchen counter together. Remember to stay calm, we'll find them.
Person A: Okay, I'll try to calm down. Let's go check the kitchen counter.
