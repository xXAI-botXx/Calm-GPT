Person A: Hey, I'm really struggling with exam anxiety. Every time I have to take a test, I just get so nervous and it affects my performance. I don't know what to do.

Person B: I completely understand. It can be really tough to deal with exam anxiety. Have you tried any relaxation techniques to help calm your nerves?

Person A: No, not really. I've heard of meditation, but I'm not sure how it works or if it would actually help me.

Person B: Meditation can definitely be beneficial, but let me show you a simple breathing exercise that you can try. It's called 4-7-8 breathing. 

Person A: Okay, I'm willing to try anything at this point. How does it work?

Person B: First, find a comfortable position and close your eyes. Then, take a deep breath in through your nose for a count of 4.

Person A: Like this? *Takes a deep breath in for a count of 4*

Person B: Yes, exactly! Now hold your breath for a count of 7.

Person A: *Holds breath for a count of 7*

Person B: Great job! Now, slowly exhale through your mouth for a count of 8.

Person A: *Exhales slowly for a count of 8*

Person B: Wonderful! Repeat this cycle three more times, for a total of four cycles. Focus on the breath and try to let go of any tension or nervousness as you exhale.

Person A: Thank you so much for showing me this technique. I can already feel a sense of calmness and relaxation. I will definitely incorporate this into my exam preparations.

Person B: You're welcome! I'm glad it's helping. Remember, practice this technique regularly, not just during exams, to help manage your overall anxiety level. Good luck with your exams!

Person A: Thank you again for your support. I really appreciate it.
