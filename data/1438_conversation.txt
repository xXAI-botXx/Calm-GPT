Person B: It sounds like you're carrying a heavy load. Is there anything specific that's causing you the most stress? 
Person A: Well, work has been really demanding and I haven't been able to find a good work-life balance. It's affecting my relationships and my health.

Person B: That's a great first step. Remember, you deserve to have a healthy work-life balance. Let me know how it goes, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need more support.
