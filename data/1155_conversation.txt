Person A: Hey 
Person B: Hey, how are you? 
Person A: I've been feeling really anxious lately. I think I have Separation Anxiety Disorder. 
Person B: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about it? 
Person A: It's when I feel really panicked and scared when I'm away from someone I'm attached to, like my partner or family. 
Person B: I see. How often does this happen? 
Person A: It's happening almost every day now. I can't even leave the house without feeling overwhelmed. 
Person B: That sounds really tough. Is there anything that helps you feel better? 
Person A: Being around the person I'm attached to gives me some relief, but it's not always possible. 
Person B: Have you tried any relaxation techniques, like deep breathing or meditation? 
Person A: Yeah, I've tried deep breathing, but it only helps temporarily. The anxiety comes back. 
Person B: I understand. It can be challenging to find what works for you. Have you talked to a therapist about it? 
Person A: No, I haven't reached out for professional help yet. 
Person B: Maybe that could offer some additional support and guidance. They might be able to teach you coping mechanisms specifically tailored to your situation. 
Person A: Yeah, you're right. I should give it a try. Thanks for listening and suggesting that. 
Person B: Of course! I'm always here to listen and support you. You're doing great taking steps to explore options for managing your anxiety.
