Person A: Hey, I'm really nervous about my upcoming exams. I have terrible test anxiety.
Person B: I understand how you feel. Have you tried any relaxation techniques to help calm your nerves?
Person A: No, not yet. Do you have any suggestions?
Person B: Well, a simple breathing exercise can do wonders. Take a deep breath in through your nose, hold it for a few seconds, and then slowly exhale through your mouth.
Person A: That sounds simple enough. I'll give it a try. 
Person B: Great! Remember to take slow and deep breaths, focusing on your breath as you inhale and exhale.
Person A: Okay, I'll make sure to concentrate on my breathing. 
Person B: Also, try to find a quiet and comfortable space when you start feeling anxious. It can help create a calm atmosphere for you to relax.
Person A: I'll find a quiet spot in the library to practice this breathing exercise before my exams. 
Person B: That sounds like a good plan. Just remember to take it one step at a time and don't put too much pressure on yourself. You'll do great!
Person A: Thank you for your help and support. I really appreciate it.
Person B: You're welcome. I'm here for you anytime you need to talk or if you have any other questions. Good luck with your exams!
