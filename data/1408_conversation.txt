Person A: Hey
Person B: Hey, how are you?
Person A: I'm feeling so overwhelmed right now.
Person B: I understand. What's been going on?
Person A: I just started a new job and it's really challenging.
Person B: Change can be quite stressful. What specifically has been difficult for you?
Person A: I feel like I'm not catching on as quickly as I should. I'm worried about not meeting expectations.
Person B: It's understandable to feel that way, especially when starting something new. Remember, it takes time to adjust and learn. Have you communicated your concerns to your supervisor?
Person A: Not yet. I'm afraid they might think I'm not capable.
Person B: It's important to voice your concerns so that your supervisor can provide support and guidance. It doesn't mean you're incapable, but rather that you're proactive in seeking help. You deserve to have your needs met.
Person A: You're right. I'll schedule a meeting with them tomorrow.
Person B: That sounds like a good plan. Let me know how it goes. Remember, you're doing great and it's normal to face challenges when starting something new.
Person A: Thanks for understanding and offering support. It means a lot.
Person B: No problem at all. That's what friends are for. I'm always here for you.
