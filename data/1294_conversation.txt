Person A: Hey, I'm feeling really anxious right now.
Person B: Hey, it's going to be okay. Just take a deep breath and try to relax.
Person A: But I can't stop worrying about the future.
Person B: I understand, but remember that dwelling on the future won't change anything. Accept the feeling and focus on the present.
Person A: I know, but it feels overwhelming.
Person B: I know it's tough, but trust that everything will work out in the end. You're capable of handling whatever comes your way.
Person A: It's just hard to see that right now.
Person B: I get it. Sometimes it's difficult to see the light at the end of the tunnel, but things will get better. Give it time.
Person A: I wish I could do something to stop feeling this way.
Person B: Accept that you can't control everything right now. Sometimes all we can do is accept the feeling and be patient until it passes.
Person A: I guess you're right. I just need to be patient.
Person B: That's it. Take it one step at a time, and soon enough, you'll start feeling better. Hang in there.
