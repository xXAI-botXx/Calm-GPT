Person A: Hi, I've been feeling really anxious lately, and I just found out I have Substance/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder.

Person B: Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear that. Is there anything I can do to help?

Person A: I appreciate that. Honestly, I'm feeling overwhelmed and scared. I don't know how to deal with this.

Person B: It's understandable to feel that way, but remember you're not alone in this. Have you talked to a professional about your diagnosis?

Person A: Yes, I have. They prescribed medication to help manage my anxiety symptoms.

Person B: That's a positive step! Medication can be really beneficial. Have you started taking it yet?

Person A: Yes, I just started. But I'm worried about the side effects and if it will really make a difference.

Person B: It's normal to have concerns, but trust me, sometimes it just takes a little time for the medication to kick in and make a noticeable impact. Try to give it a chance.

Person A: I'll try my best. But what if it doesn't work or if the side effects are too severe?

Person B: Understandably, you might be worried about that. Remember, everyone reacts differently. It's important to communicate any concerns or side effects with your healthcare provider. They can help adjust your medication or find alternative options.

Person A: I guess you're right. I shouldn't jump to conclusions before giving it a fair chance. It's scary though.

Person B: Absolutely, change can be scary. But your well-being is worth it, and it's amazing that you're seeking help. Try to stay positive and know that I'm here for you every step of the way.

Person A: Thank you so much for being supportive and understanding. It means a lot to me.

Person B: Of course! We all have our battles in life, and supporting each other is what friends are for. Remember, you're strong, and I have faith that you can overcome this challenge.
