Person A: Hey, are you available? I'm feeling really panicked right now. 
Person B: Hey, I'm here for you. What's going on? 
Person A: It's just... I'm so afraid of failing this exam. I haven't been able to concentrate, and the pressure is getting to me. 
Person B: I understand how overwhelming exams can be. Remember, it's just one exam, and it doesn't determine your worth. What's the worst thing that could happen if you fail? 
Person A: Well, I guess I would have to retake the course and it would delay my graduation. 
Person B: That's true, but think about it this way. By retaking the course, you'll have more time to deepen your knowledge and build a stronger foundation. Plus, you'll have another chance to engage with your classmates and maybe even make new friends. 
Person A: Hmm, I never thought about it that way. I guess there could be some positive aspects to retaking the course. 
Person B: Absolutely! It's all about shifting our perspective. Challenges often present opportunities for growth. And hey, even if you don't fail, you'll have a great story to tell in the future about how you conquered your exam fears. 
Person A: You're right. I shouldn't let this fear consume me. Thank you for helping me see a different perspective. 
Person B: You're welcome. Just remember, I'm here to support you no matter what. You've got this!
