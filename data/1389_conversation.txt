Person B: I'm sorry to hear that. What's been going on?
Person A: I just got rejected for a job I really wanted. I feel like a failure.
Person B: I understand how disappointing that must feel. Remember, this is just one setback. You have many other strengths and opportunities ahead of you.
Person A: I know, but it's hard not to focus on this one failure.
Person B: I totally get it. But try to shift your focus towards the positive things in your life. What are you proud of accomplishing recently?
Person A: Well, I recently finished a project that I put a lot of effort into. I was really happy with how it turned out.
Person B: That's fantastic! See, you're capable of achieving great things. This setback doesn't define you. Try to think of it as a learning experience.
Person A: You're right. It's just hard not to let it get to me sometimes.
Person B: It's completely normal to feel down, but remind yourself of your worth. You have so much potential and resilience. Keep pushing forward!
