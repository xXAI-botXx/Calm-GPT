Person A: Hey, are you there?
Person B: Hey, how can I help?
Person A: I'm freaking out right now!
Person B: Take a deep breath. Now, tell me three words that come to your mind.
Person A: Dark, spiders, alone.
Person B: Imagine this – you're in a cozy cabin, surrounded by dim candlelight. Suddenly, a spider sneaks in, but it's just a tiny cute one wearing sunglasses and playing the guitar. You're not alone, because your pet parrot starts singing along. How does that make you feel?
Person A: Haha, that actually made me smile. Thanks!
Person B: You're welcome! Remember, sometimes a little humor can lighten up even the darkest moments. Is there anything else I can do for you?
