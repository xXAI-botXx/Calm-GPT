Person A: I can't believe this is happening again. I'm feeling so panicked right now.

Person B: Hey, take deep breaths. You've got this. What's causing you to panic?

Person A: I have to give a presentation in front of a large audience tomorrow, and the thought of it is making me feel overwhelmed.

Person B: I understand that it can be nerve-wracking, but remember that you've prepared for this. You know your content inside out.

Person A: But what if I mess up or forget what to say? I'm afraid of looking foolish in front of everyone.

Person B: It's normal to have those thoughts, but don't let them consume you. Remember that everyone in the audience wants you to succeed, and they are there to support you.

Person A: I guess you're right. I need to focus more on the positive and build my confidence.

Person B: Exactly! You've accomplished so much already, and this presentation is just another step forward. Break it down into smaller tasks, practice, and trust in your abilities. You've got this.

Person A: Thank you for being so understanding and encouraging. Your words really help calm me down.

Person B: You're welcome! I believe in you, and I know you'll do great. Remember, breathe and stay positive.
