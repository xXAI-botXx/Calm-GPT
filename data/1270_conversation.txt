Person A: Hey, are you there?
Person B: Hey, what's up?
Person A: I'm freaking out! I have so much work to do and I don't know where to start!
Person B: Take a deep breath. Close your eyes. Imagine you're standing at the entrance of a magical forest. You see a path in front of you. What do you do?
Person A: I guess I would start walking on the path.
Person B: As you walk, you notice a friendly squirrel following you. It starts talking to you! What does it say?
Person A: Umm, it tells me not to worry and that everything will work out in the end.
Person B: That's right! The squirrel guides you to a beautiful meadow filled with blooming flowers. What do you do there?
Person A: I take a moment to appreciate the beauty and relax.
Person B: As you relax, you see a small fairy fluttering towards you. She grants you three wishes. What are your wishes?
Person A: I wish for the ability to stay focused, to be organized, and for all my work to be completed effortlessly.
Person B: The fairy grants your wishes and disappears. You feel a surge of confidence and motivation. What's the first thing you do now?
Person A: I sit down at my desk and start working on my tasks, feeling calm and determined.
Person B: That's wonderful! Remember, you have the power to overcome any challenge. You've got this!
