Person A: I can't handle this anymore! I'm in such a state of panic right now.

Person B: Take a deep breath and try to calm down. What happened?

Person A: I just realized that I forgot my passport at home, and my flight is in two hours. I don't know what to do!

Person B: Okay, I understand that it's a stressful situation, but let's think logically. Is there anyone who can bring your passport to the airport?

Person A: No, unfortunately not. Everyone I know is working and can't get away.

Person B: Alright, let's explore other options. Is there a possibility to reschedule your flight or get a new passport issued before your next available flight?

Person A: I don't think I can reschedule without paying a hefty fee, and getting a new passport within a few hours seems impossible.

Person B: Don't panic just yet. Let's check with the airline if they have any provisions for situations like this. They might have dealt with similar cases before.

Person A: That's a good idea. I will call them right away.

Person B: While you do that, take a few more deep breaths and try to keep a clear mind. Remember, panicking won't solve the problem, but staying calm and rational might help in finding a solution.

Person A: Thank you for reminding me to stay calm. I'm feeling a bit better now. I will call the airline and see if they can offer any assistance.
