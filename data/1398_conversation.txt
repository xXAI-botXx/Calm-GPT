Person A: Hey 
Person B: Hey, how are you? 
Person A: Not great, I've been feeling really anxious lately. 
Person B: Oh no, what's been bothering you? 
Person A: I don't know, it's just this fear of the unknown. I can't stop thinking about all the things that could go wrong. 
Person B: I completely understand. But have you ever considered that the unknown can also bring wonderful surprises and opportunities? 
Person A: I guess so, but it's so hard to focus on the positive when I can't predict what's going to happen. 
Person B: That's true, but trying to control everything is not realistic. Embracing the unknown can lead to personal growth and exciting adventures. 
Person A: But what if everything goes wrong? What if I make the wrong choices? 
Person B: We all make mistakes sometimes, but those mistakes help us learn and make better decisions in the future. Plus, what if everything goes right? 
Person A: I never thought about it that way. I suppose there's a chance for good things to happen too. 
Person B: Absolutely! And remember, you're not alone in this journey. You have friends and loved ones who will support you no matter what. 
Person A: That's true. Thank you for reminding me that I don't have to face the unknown alone. 
Person B: You're welcome! Just take one step at a time and believe in yourself. You've got this!
