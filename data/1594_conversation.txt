Storyteller: Keep going deeper into the cave, and as you do, you come across a narrow stream of sparkling water. The water is incredibly clear and reflects the golden light, creating a mesmerizing show of shimmer and shine. Take a moment to imagine the sound of the water gently flowing, and allow that sound to wash away any lingering tension or worries.

With each touch, imagine your worries gently dissolving away, leaving you feeling lighter and free. Allow the stream to cleanse your thoughts and bring you a sense of clarity and peace.

User: I'm sitting by the stream, immersing my fingers in the water. The worries seem to disappear, leaving me with a sense of calmness and clarity.
