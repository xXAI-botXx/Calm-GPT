Person B: Hey, how are you?
Person A: I've been feeling really alone lately.
Person B: I'm here for you. Remember that. You're never truly alone.
Person A: It's just hard sometimes, you know? I feel like no one understands.
Person B: I understand how you feel. Sometimes it seems like the whole world is against us, but we have to stay strong and believe in ourselves.
Person A: I appreciate your words, but it's still tough.
Person B: I have an idea! Let's play a game to distract ourselves for a while. How about 20 questions? I'll think of something and you try to guess what it is.
Person A: That sounds fun, let's do it!
Person B: Okay, I've got something in mind. Is it an animal?

Person A: No.
Person B: Is it a terrestrial animal?
Person A: Yes.
Person B: Is it a mammal?
Person A: No.
Person B: Is it a reptile?
Person A: Yes!
Person B: Is it a snake?
Person A: No, but close.
Person B: Is it a lizard?
Person A: Yes, that's right! You got it!
Person B: Yay! See? Even in tough moments, we can find joy in simple things like games. Keep your spirits up, my friend. You're never alone, and we'll get through this together.
