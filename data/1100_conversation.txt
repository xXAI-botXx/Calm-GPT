Person A: Hey, are you available?

Person B: Yes, what's going on?

Person A: I'm feeling really overwhelmed and panicky right now.

Person B: I'm sorry to hear that. Take a deep breath and try to calm down.

Person A: I don't know what to do. Everything feels like it's falling apart.

Person B: Remember to take it one step at a time. What specifically is causing you the most distress?

Person A: My workload is overwhelming, and I can't seem to keep up. I feel like I'm drowning.

Person B: I understand how that feels. But let's break it down. What are the most urgent tasks you need to focus on?

Person A: There are so many deadlines. I don't even know where to start.

Person B: Take a moment to prioritize. Identify the tasks that have the nearest deadlines and start with those. Remember, you can only do one thing at a time.

Person A: You're right. I need to take it step by step. I'll start with the most pressing deadline first.

Person B: That sounds like a great plan. And don't forget to take breaks in between tasks to recharge and relax.

Person A: Thank you for guiding me through this. I feel calmer already.

Person B: You're welcome. Remember, I'm here for you. Just take it one step at a time, and you'll get through it.
