Patient: Good morning, doctor. 
Psychologist: Good morning. How are you feeling today? 
Patient: I've been feeling really down lately. I just can't seem to shake off this constant sense of sadness. 
Psychologist: I see. Can you tell me a bit more about what might be causing these feelings of sadness? 
Patient: Well, I've been going through a difficult breakup recently, and it's been hard for me to cope with the loss. I think it's affecting all aspects of my life. 
Psychologist: Breakups can be extremely tough, and it's completely normal to experience a range of emotions during this time. How are you coping with the breakup currently? 
Patient: I've been isolating myself from friends and family, and I find it really hard to get out of bed in the mornings. I just feel so exhausted all the time. 
Psychologist: It sounds like you're going through a really tough time right now. Is there anything that has helped you in the past when you've dealt with difficult situations? 
Patient: Well, I used to find solace in painting and writing, but I just can't seem to find the motivation to engage in those activities anymore. 
Psychologist: It's understandable that you feel unmotivated right now, but engaging in activities you used to enjoy can help alleviate some of the sadness you're experiencing. Maybe we can work on finding small steps to get you back into those activities. 
Patient: That might be worth a try. I just want to feel like myself again. 
Psychologist: I completely understand. Let's start by setting some small goals that can help you reconnect with your hobbies. Are there any other concerns or issues you'd like to discuss today? 
Patient: Not at the moment, but I really appreciate your help and guidance through this difficult time. 
Psychologist: You're welcome. Remember, we're in this together, and I'm here to support you every step of the way. We'll work together to help you regain a sense of happiness and fulfillment in your life. 
Patient: Thank you, doctor. I look forward to our next session.
