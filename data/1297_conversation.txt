Person A: Hey 
Person B: Hey, how are you? 
Person A: I'm feeling really alone right now. 
Person B: I'm sorry to hear that. Remember, you're not alone. I'm here for you. 
Person A: Thank you, it means a lot to me. 
Person B: No problem, anytime. Is there something specific that's making you feel alone? 
Person A: I've been struggling with some personal issues and it's just been hard lately. 
Person B: I understand. Remember, you're strong and capable of overcoming anything. Keep your head up! 
Person A: I'll try, but it's just been difficult to stay positive. 
Person B: I get it. Sometimes it helps to do something fun to distract ourselves. How about we play a little game together? 
Person A: Okay, sounds good. What game do you have in mind? 
Person B: How about a game of 20 Questions? I'll think of something and you try to guess what it is by asking me yes or no questions. It might help take your mind off things. 
Person A: That sounds like a great idea! Let's do it. 
Person B: Alright, I've thought of something. You can start asking your questions now.
