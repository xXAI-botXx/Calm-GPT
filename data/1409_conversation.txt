Person A: Hey
Person B: Hey, how are you?
Person A: I don't know, I'm just really panicking right now.
Person B: Oh no, I'm here for you. What's making you panic?
Person A: I have this big presentation tomorrow and I'm so scared that I'll mess it up.
Person B: I understand how nerve-wracking presentations can be. But you know what? Picture the audience in their underwear, it always helps me to lighten the mood.
Person A: Haha, that actually sounds funny. I guess imagining them in funny underwear would definitely make me laugh.
Person B: Exactly! And you'll be amazed how laughter can change your perspective. You've got this, just remember to have fun with it.
Person A: Thank you so much for the advice and for making me laugh. I really needed that.
