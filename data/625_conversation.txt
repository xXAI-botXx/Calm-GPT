Therapist: Good morning, how are you feeling today?
Patient: I've been feeling really overwhelmed and stressed lately. It's been hard to cope with everything going on in my life.

Therapist: I understand, stress can take a toll on our mental health. Remember, you are not alone in this journey. We'll work through it together.

Patient: I appreciate that, but sometimes it feels like I just can't handle it all. The anxiety keeps creeping in and it's hard to shake off.

Therapist: It's completely normal to feel that way. Anxiety can make everything seem bigger than it actually is. However, you are stronger than you realize. Let's focus on your strengths and build resilience.

Patient: I guess I've just been doubting myself a lot lately. I've been questioning whether I'm capable of handling all these challenges and responsibilities.

Therapist: Doubts are natural, but it's important to acknowledge your accomplishments and the skills you have. Remember all the times you've overcome obstacles before. You are capable, and I have confidence in your ability to face whatever comes your way.

Patient: Thank you for your kind words. It's hard to see my own potential sometimes, especially when I'm feeling so low.

Therapist: That's why I'm here to help remind you of your worth and the abundance of strength you possess. Remember, setbacks are opportunities for growth. Don't be too hard on yourself. Take things one step at a time, and trust in yourself.

Patient: I'll try my best to shift my perspective and focus on the positive. It's just good to have someone who truly believes in me.

Therapist: You are not alone in this journey, and I genuinely believe in your ability to thrive. I'm here to support you every step of the way. Be kind to yourself and remember that you have the power to overcome anything.

Patient: Thank you, I needed to hear that. I'll do my best to stay positive and believe in myself.

Therapist: You're doing amazing already. Remember, progress is not always linear, but as long as you keep trying and stay committed to your well-being, you'll see positive changes. Keep up the great work!
