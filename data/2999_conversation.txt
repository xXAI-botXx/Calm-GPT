Storyteller: Now, as you continue to sit by the riverside, notice the vibrant colors of the surrounding flowers and plants. Marvel at their beauty as they sway gently in the breeze. Choose one flower that catches your attention. Reach out and touch its petals, feeling their delicate texture against your fingertips. How does it make you feel?
