Person A: I can't believe this is happening! I'm feeling really anxious and panicky right now.

Person B: I understand how you're feeling. Take a deep breath and try to focus on your breathing. Inhale slowly for 4 seconds, hold it for 4 seconds, and then exhale for 4 seconds.

Person A: (Takes a deep breath) Okay, I did that. But I still feel overwhelmed.

Person B: That's okay. Let's try a grounding exercise. Look around you and find five things you can see, four things you can touch, three things you can hear, two things you can smell, and one thing you can taste.

Person A: Okay... I see my phone, a pen, a plant, a book, and a lamp. I can touch the table, my hair, the carpet, and a pillow. I can hear the birds outside, the sound of traffic, and my own breathing.

Person B: Great job! That's a great way to bring your attention to the present moment. Now, let's try some positive self-talk. Repeat after me: "I am safe and capable of handling this situation."

Person A: (Repeats) "I am safe and capable of handling this situation."

Person B: That's right! Remember, you've overcome challenging situations in the past, and you can overcome this one too. You're stronger than you think.

Person A: Thank you for being so supportive. It really helps to have someone to talk to and guide me through this panic.

Person B: You're welcome. I'm always here for you. Just take it one step at a time and remember to be kind to yourself. You're doing great!
