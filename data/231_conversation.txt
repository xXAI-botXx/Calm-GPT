Patient: Good morning, doctor. I've been feeling really down lately.
Psychologist: Good morning. I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about what you're experiencing?
Patient: Well, I've been having trouble sleeping and my appetite has decreased. I also find it difficult to concentrate and enjoy things that used to bring me pleasure.
Psychologist: I see. How long have you been feeling this way?
Patient: It's been about a month now. I've tried to shake it off, but it just seems to be getting worse.
Psychologist: Have you noticed any specific triggers or events that might have contributed to your current state?
Patient: Not really, no. It just feels like everything has become overwhelming and I can't seem to find joy in anything anymore.
Psychologist: It sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. I would like to explore this further with you, if that's okay.
Patient: Yes, I would appreciate that. I just want to understand what's happening to me and how I can feel better.
Psychologist: Don't worry. We'll work together to figure this out. I'd like to ask you some more questions about your daily life and any recent stressful situations.
Patient: Okay, I'm open to answering any questions you have. I really want to get back to feeling like myself again.
Psychologist: That's great to hear. Now, let's start by discussing your sleep patterns and any changes you've noticed in your energy levels.
