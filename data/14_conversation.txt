Person A: Hey, can I talk to you about something that happened today? 
Person B: Of course, I'm here to listen. What's going on? 
Person A: Well, I had a meeting at work and I made a mistake that ended up costing the company a lot of money. I feel really terrible about it. 
Person B: I'm really sorry to hear that. It sounds like a difficult situation. How are you feeling about it? 
Person A: I feel really guilty and ashamed. I can't believe I messed up like that. 
Person B: It's completely understandable to feel that way. Mistakes happen, and it's okay to acknowledge the impact they have. Remember, everyone makes mistakes at some point. 
Person A: I know, but I just can't stop thinking about how it will affect my reputation at work. I feel like everyone will see me as incompetent. 
Person B: I can understand why you would feel that way, but it's important to remember that one mistake doesn't define your capabilities or worth. Have you talked to anyone at work about what happened? 
Person A: Not yet. I've been avoiding it because I'm afraid of the consequences. 
Person B: I think it would be a good idea to talk to your supervisor or someone you trust at work. They may be able to provide guidance and support. Remember, asking for help is a strength, not a weakness. 
Person A: You're right. I'll try to gather the courage to talk to my supervisor tomorrow. Thank you for listening and for your understanding. 
Person B: Of course, anytime. I'm here for you. Don't forget to be kind to yourself throughout this process. We all make mistakes, and it's how we learn and grow from them that truly matters.
