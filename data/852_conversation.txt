Patient: Good morning, Dr. Smith. Thank you for seeing me today.
Psychologist: Good morning. It's my pleasure to assist you. How are you feeling today?
Patient: Honestly, I've been feeling quite down lately. I've been struggling with continuous sadness and a lack of motivation.
Psychologist: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about what might have triggered these feelings for you? 
Patient: I think it all started when I lost my job a few months ago. Since then, I've been having trouble finding new employment, and it's made me question my worth and abilities.
Psychologist: Losing a job can be a significant source of stress and can certainly affect one's self-esteem. How has this impacted other areas of your life, such as your relationships or daily activities?
Patient: It's definitely strained my relationships, especially with my partner. I've been withdrawing from social situations, and I've noticed a decrease in my overall energy levels. I used to enjoy hobbies and activities, but now I just feel empty and unmotivated.
Psychologist: Understandably, these changes can be difficult to cope with. It's positive that you've recognized these shifts and are seeking help. Have you noticed any patterns or specific thoughts that tend to come up during this time?
Patient: Yes, most of the time, I find myself thinking that I'm a failure and that things will never improve. I often dwell on past mistakes and my perceived inadequacies, which only adds to my negative thoughts.
Psychologist: Negative thought patterns like these can be quite common when facing challenging situations. It's essential to remember that these thoughts don't define your worth as a person. Together, we can work on replacing these negative thoughts with more positive and realistic ones. Are you open to exploring some coping mechanisms?
Patient: Absolutely, I'm willing to try anything that can help me feel better. What strategies can we work on?
Psychologist: We can start by identifying some of your strengths and accomplishments, even if they may seem small at first. Additionally, we can work on challenging those negative thoughts by examining evidence that contradicts them. It may also be helpful to incorporate self-care activities into your daily routine to improve your mood and overall well-being.
