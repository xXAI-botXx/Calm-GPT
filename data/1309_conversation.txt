Person A: Hey
Person B: Hey, how are you feeling today?
Person A: Not great, to be honest. I've been feeling really sad and overwhelmed lately.
Person B: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you pinpoint any specific triggers for your sadness and overwhelm?
Person A: Well, I've been dealing with a lot of stress at work and it's been really affecting my sleep and overall mood.
Person B: It sounds like work is really taking a toll on your well-being. Have you tried talking to your supervisor or finding ways to manage your workload?
Person A: I haven't really talked to my supervisor about it yet. I guess I'm afraid it might make things worse.
Person B: I understand your concern, but it's important to communicate your needs and concerns. Maybe consider scheduling a meeting with your supervisor to discuss your workload and find possible solutions.
Person A: Yeah, you're right. I'll try to gain the courage to talk to them. Thanks for the advice.
Person B: You're welcome. Remember, taking care of your mental health should be a priority. Don't hesitate to reach out for support if you need it.
Person A: Thanks, I really appreciate your support. It means a lot to me.
Person B: I'm here for you anytime you need to talk. Take care of yourself, my friend.
