Person A: Oh my gosh, I can't believe this! I just received a letter saying that I've been selected for an audit. I don't know what to do!

Person B: Take a deep breath, it's going to be okay. Audits are not the end of the world. Let's stay positive and figure out a plan.

Person A: But what if they find something wrong? I've never been audited before and it's making me so nervous.

Person B: I understand your worries, but remember that audits are just a routine process to ensure everything is in order. Let's focus on gathering all the necessary documents and evidence to support your case.

Person A: I just don't even know where to start. It feels overwhelming.

Person B: I'll help you with that. We can start by going through all your receipts and organizing them. I'll create a checklist for you to make sure we have all the required documents.

Person A: That would be really helpful. Thank you for being there for me.

Person B: Of course, you don't have to go through this alone. Remember to take breaks when you feel overwhelmed and reach out for support if you need it.

Person A: You're right. I can do this. Having you by my side makes me feel better about the whole situation.

Person B: That's the spirit! Just stay focused, remain positive, and trust that everything will work out fine. You've got this!
