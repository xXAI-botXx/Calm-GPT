Person B: It sounds like you're under a lot of pressure. How does that make you feel?
Person A: It's causing me a lot of anxiety. I constantly worry about not meeting expectations.
Person B: It's completely normal to feel anxious in such situations. Have you tried any relaxation techniques to help calm your mind?
Person A: I've tried doing some deep breathing exercises, but it doesn't seem to work for me.
Person B: That's alright. It's important to find a technique that works for you. Maybe you could explore other methods like meditation or progressive muscle relaxation.

Person B: Anytime. Just remember, I'm here for support whenever you need it.
