Person A: Hey, I wanted to talk to you about something that's been on my mind lately. It's about my selective mutism.

Person B: Oh, I'm here for you! Please tell me more about it. I'm really curious to understand and support you.

Person A: Well, selective mutism is an anxiety disorder that makes it difficult for me to speak in certain situations, even though I want to. It's like my words get stuck.

Person B: That sounds tough, but I appreciate you opening up to me about it. Do you experience it all the time or only in specific situations?

Person A: It mainly happens in social situations, especially when there are people I'm not very familiar with. It can be really frustrating because I want to participate and communicate, but the anxiety holds me back.

Person B: I can only imagine how overwhelming that must feel. But please remember, you don't have to face it alone. Is there anything specific that triggers your selective mutism?

Person A: It's usually triggered by feeling judged or evaluated, even in the smallest interactions. It's like my anxiety takes over and makes it almost impossible to speak.

Person B: I'm really sorry to hear that. Just know that you are not being judged by me or anyone else who cares about you. We value you for who you are, not for your ability to speak. Is there anything I can do to help you during those moments?

Person A: Thank you for your support. Sometimes, it would be helpful if you could gently encourage me to express myself, but without exerting too much pressure. Just giving me space and time can make a big difference.

Person B: Absolutely, I'll keep that in mind. And if there's ever a situation where you're struggling, let me know how I can best support you in that moment. We can find ways to work together and make sure you feel comfortable.

Person A: Thank you so much for being understanding and positive about this. It means a lot to me. Having someone like you in my corner makes this journey a little bit easier.

Person B: Of course, I'm always here for you. Your well-being is important to me, and I believe in your strength to overcome any challenges. Remember, you are more than your selective mutism, and I cherish every part of you.

Person A: That really means a lot. Thank you for being so caring. It gives me hope and confidence to face this head-on.
