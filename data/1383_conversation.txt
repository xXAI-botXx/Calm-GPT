Person A: Hey 
Person B: Hey, how are you? 
Person A: Not great, honestly. I've been feeling really down lately. 
Person B: I'm here for you. Can you tell me more about what's been going on? 
Person A: It's just been a lot of stress at work and I've been feeling overwhelmed. 
Person B: I understand. When did you start feeling this way? 
Person A: It's been going on for a few weeks now. 
Person B: How have you been coping with the stress? 
Person A: I've been trying to distract myself with hobbies, but it hasn't been helping much. 
Person B: Have you considered talking to someone about how you're feeling, like a therapist or counselor? 
Person A: I haven't really thought about it, but maybe it could be helpful. 
Person B: It could be worth exploring. Sometimes talking to a professional can provide valuable insight and support. 
Person A: Yeah, I guess I'm just hesitant to reach out. 
Person B: It's completely understandable to feel hesitant. Remember that seeking help is a sign of strength. 
Person A: You're right. I shouldn't be afraid to ask for help. 
Person B: It's okay to lean on others during tough times. You don't have to go through it alone. 
Person A: Thank you for being there for me. I appreciate it. 
Person B: Of course, anytime. I'm here to support you.
