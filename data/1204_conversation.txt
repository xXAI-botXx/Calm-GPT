Person A: Hey 
Person B: Hey, how are you? 
Person A: Not great, actually. I've been feeling really anxious lately.
Person B: I'm really sorry to hear that. How long has this been going on?
Person A: It's been a few weeks now. I just can't seem to shake this feeling of worry and fear. It's overwhelming.
Person B: I can imagine how tough that must be. Have you spoken to anyone about it?
Person A: Not really. I haven't been sure how to bring it up or who to talk to.
Person B: Well, I'm glad you opened up to me. It's important not to keep these things bottled up. Have you considered reaching out to a professional?
Person A: I've been thinking about it, but I'm worried about what they might tell me.
Person B: I understand your concerns, but seeking professional help can be a really positive step towards managing your anxiety. They can provide you with strategies and support.
Person A: I guess you're right. Maybe it's time I seek some guidance.
Person B: That's great to hear. Remember, you're not alone in this. There are many people who understand and can help. Is there anything I can do to support you right now?
Person A: Just talking to you about it is already a big help. Thank you for listening and being so positive.
Person B: Of course, anytime! Remember, self-care is important too. Take some time for yourself and do things that help you relax.
Person A: Will do. Thanks again for being there for me.
Person B: Anytime. You've got this!
