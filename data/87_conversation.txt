Person A: I don't know what to do, I just can't stop feeling anxious about everything.

Person B: Take a deep breath. Everything is going to be alright, trust me.

Person A: But what if things don't work out? What if I mess up?

Person B: It's natural to have those thoughts, but overthinking won't change the outcome. Just focus on what you can control in the present moment.

Person A: It's hard not to think about the future. I feel so overwhelmed.

Person B: I understand how you feel, but worrying about the future won't make it any easier. Accept the feeling, but remember that it's temporary. Things will get better soon.

Person A: I guess you're right. I'll try to let go of the worry and focus on what's happening right now.

Person B: That's the right mindset. Remember, you're not alone in this. Reach out for support if you need it. Just take it one step at a time, and you'll find your way through.
