Person A: Oh my gosh, I can't believe it! I just found out that my flight got cancelled and I have no idea what to do now. I'm in a total panic!

Person B: Take a deep breath, everything will be okay. Let's try to distract you from this situation. How about we play a game?

Person A: Are you serious? How can playing a game help me right now?

Person B: Trust me, sometimes a little distraction can work wonders. Let's play "Would You Rather." I'll start. Would you rather have the ability to fly or the ability to become invisible?

Person A: Um, I guess I would rather have the ability to fly. It would be amazing to see the world from above. Now it's your turn. Would you rather be able to teleport or read minds?

Person B: Hmm, tough choice. I think I would choose teleportation. It would make traveling so much easier. Okay, next question. Would you rather have the power of super strength or super speed?

Person A: Definitely super speed. I could get so much done in a short amount of time. Alright, now it's my turn. Would you rather be able to speak every language fluently or have the power of perfect memory?

Person B: That's a tough one, but I think I would choose the power of perfect memory. It would be so helpful in so many aspects of life. Alright, let's keep going.

Person A: Thank you for distracting me with this game. I actually feel a lot better now.

Person B: You're welcome! Sometimes taking a step back and doing something fun can help alleviate panic. Remember, there's always a solution to every problem. We'll figure out the flight situation together.
