Person B: Hey, how are you?
Person A: Not so great, I've been feeling really stressed lately.

Person A: I have so much work to do and I feel overwhelmed. 
Person B: I understand, it can be tough. But let me tell you a funny story that might cheer you up. 
Person A: Okay, go ahead. 
Person B: So, the other day, I was rushing to catch the bus and I accidentally tripped and fell right in front of everyone! I was so embarrassed, but looking back, it's actually pretty hilarious.

Person B: You're welcome! Sometimes it helps to lighten the mood with a good laugh. Anything else I can do to help you feel better?
