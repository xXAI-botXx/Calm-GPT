Person B: Hi there, I'm here for you. What's been going on?
Person A: I just lost my job and I don't know what to do.
Person B: I'm so sorry to hear that. Losing a job can be really tough. How are you coping with it?
Person A: I've been feeling anxious and stressed. I can't stop worrying about my financial situation.
Person B: It's completely normal to feel anxious and stressed in this situation. Have you considered reaching out to any job support groups or seeking professional help?
Person A: I haven't thought about that. Do you think it would be helpful?
