Patient: Good morning, Dr. Smith. I've been feeling really down lately. 
Psychologist: Good morning, John. I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about what you've been experiencing? 
Patient: Well, I've been feeling a lot of sadness and I don't enjoy the things I used to. I also have trouble sleeping and have lost my appetite. 
Psychologist: It sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. How long have you been feeling this way? 
Patient: It's been going on for a few weeks now. I've tried to shake it off, but it's just not getting any better. 
Psychologist: I'm glad you reached out for help. It's important to address these feelings. Have you noticed any specific triggers or events that might have contributed to this change in mood? 
Patient: I recently went through a breakup, and I think that's what started this downward spiral. But even after some time has passed, I can't seem to shake off this sadness. 
Psychologist: Breakups can be really tough, and it's normal to feel down after one. It seems like this has been affecting you more deeply than you expected. Let's work on exploring these emotions and finding healthy ways to cope with the pain. 
Patient: That would be really helpful, Dr. Smith. I just want to start feeling like my old self again. 
Psychologist: We will work together to get you there, John. It's important to remember that healing takes time, but with counseling and support, you can overcome this difficult period. We'll start by setting some goals for our sessions and developing strategies to manage your emotions. 
Patient: Thank you, Dr. Smith. I appreciate your support. I'm ready to start this journey towards healing.
