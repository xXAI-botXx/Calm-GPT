Person A: Hey, can I talk to you?
Person B: Hey, sure, what's going on?
Person A: I'm freaking out right now, I lost my keys and I can't find them anywhere!
Person B: Okay, take a deep breath. Let's try to calm down. How about we start with a simple task to take your mind off things?
Person A: Alright, what do you suggest?
Person B: Can you grab a piece of paper and a pen? I want you to write down five things that make you feel happy.
Person A: Okay, I'll do that. Give me a minute.
...
Person A: Done. I wrote down spending time with friends, walking in nature, listening to music, cooking, and reading.
Person B: That's great! Now pick one of those activities and do it for the next 30 minutes. It will help you relax while we figure out the key situation.
Person A: You're right. I'll go for a walk in nature. Hopefully, it will clear my mind. Thanks for the suggestion!
Person B: No problem at all. Just remember, sometimes a small distraction can make a big difference. Let's talk later and see if you have any luck finding your keys.
