Person A: I’m just not feeling great today…

Person B: I’m really sorry to hear that. Do you want to talk about it?

Person A: I don’t know… It’s just one of those days, you know?

Person B: I understand. We all have those days. But remember, it’s okay to have a bad day. You’re human and it’s normal to feel down sometimes.

Person A: Yeah, I guess you’re right…

Person B: Absolutely! And you know what? Let’s try to shift our focus a bit. Have you seen the latest episode of that show you love?

Person A: No, I haven’t had the chance yet.

Person B: Perfect! Why don’t we watch it together? It might help to distract you a bit and who knows, it might even lift your spirits!

Person A: That sounds like a good idea. Thanks for being there for me.

Person B: Always, my friend. Let’s go enjoy that show!
