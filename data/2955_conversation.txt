Person A: Super powers.

Person B: Ah, the world of super powers, where our imagination can soar high above the clouds. Picture yourself in a lush green meadow, surrounded by vibrant flowers and gentle chirping of birds. Take a moment to settle comfortably, allowing your mind and body to relax.

Person A: Okay, I'm there now. What's next?

Person B: As you sit in this serene meadow, feel a warm, gentle breeze caress your face. Close your eyes and take a deep breath, inhaling the fragrance of wildflowers that fills the air. Exhale slowly, releasing any tension or worries that may be lingering within you.

Person A: Inhale. Exhale. I'm starting to feel more at ease. What happens next?

Person B: Suddenly, in the distance, you see a shimmering light appear. As it gets closer, the light transforms into a magnificent butterfly, with colorful wings that reflect all the colors of the rainbow. This butterfly has the power to grant you any super power you desire.

Person A: Wow, that sounds amazing. I wonder which super power I'll choose...

Person B: Take a thoughtful moment to consider the super power you intuitively feel drawn towards. Maybe it's the ability to fly, to soar gracefully through the sky like a bird. Or perhaps, you desire the power of healing, to bring comfort and wellness to those in need. Whatever it may be, trust your inner wisdom.
