User: What kind of corals are there?

Storyteller: Well, my friend, coral reefs are home to a multitude of corals, each with its unique shape and color. Some resemble delicate fans, gently swaying with the current, while others form intricate branching structures. There are also massive dome-shaped corals that create sheltered nooks and crannies for various marine creatures.
