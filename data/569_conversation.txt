Person A: It's been really tough lately. I was recently diagnosed with Substance/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder and it's been overwhelming.

Person B: Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about your diagnosis? What exactly does it mean?

Person A: Sure. It means that my anxiety symptoms are being caused or worsened by the use of substances or medications. It's like a vicious cycle because the more anxious I feel, the more I rely on substances to cope, but then they end up making my anxiety worse.

Person B: That sounds incredibly challenging. I can only imagine how difficult it must be for you. Are there any specific triggers that you've noticed?

Person A: Yeah, it's mainly triggered by certain medications I've been taking. They seem to cause an increase in my anxiety levels, making me feel on edge and panicky.

Person B: I can understand why that would be so distressing for you. Have you spoken to your healthcare provider about alternative medications or treatment options?

Person A: Yes, I've discussed it with my doctor and they are monitoring my medications closely. We're trying to find the right balance and explore other non-medication treatment approaches, like therapy and relaxation techniques.

Person B: That's great to hear that you're actively seeking other solutions. Have you tried any relaxation techniques or self-care practices that have helped alleviate your anxiety?

Person A: I've started practicing deep breathing exercises and mindfulness meditation, which have been helpful in calming my mind. I've also been making an effort to exercise regularly, as physical activity seems to provide some relief too.

Person B: That's wonderful! It's so important to find what works best for you. Is there anything specific that I can do to support you during this time?

Person A: Just your understanding and positivity means a lot to me. Sometimes I feel really down and frustrated, so having someone who listens without judgment can make a world of difference.

Person B: Of course, I'm here for you every step of the way. Don't hesitate to reach out if you need someone to talk to, or if there's anything else I can do to help ease your anxiety. You're not alone in this journey.

Person A: Thank you so much. Your support means a lot to me. It's comforting to know that I have someone like you by my side.

Person B: You're very welcome! Remember, you're strong and resilient, and together we'll find ways to overcome these challenges.
