Person A: I'm so anxious about the future. I can't stop worrying about what might happen.

Person B: Hey, it's okay to feel anxious sometimes. We all do. But remember, worrying about the future won't change anything right now. Just try to accept the feeling and give yourself some time.

Person A: I know, but it's just overwhelming. I feel like I have no control over what's going to happen.

Person B: I understand how you feel. But think about it this way: you have the power to control how you respond to whatever comes your way. Just focus on the present moment and handle things as they arise. You're capable of handling whatever comes your way.

Person A: You're right. I should try to stay in the present moment and not let my anxiety take over. It's just hard to not think about the future.

Person B: It might be hard, but it's not impossible. Take deep breaths, give yourself some self-care, and remind yourself that everything will be fine. Remember, worrying doesn't change anything, it only drains your energy. Trust that things will work out eventually. You've got this!

Person A: Thank you so much for your support. It means a lot to me. I'll try my best to stay calm and focus on the present.

Person B: You're welcome! Remember, you're not alone in this. Reach out anytime you need someone to talk to. Take it one step at a time, and everything will be better soon.
