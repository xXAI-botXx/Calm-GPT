Patient: Good morning, Dr. Smith. I've been feeling really down lately.

Psychologist: Good morning, John. I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me a bit more about what's been going on?

Patient: Well, I've been struggling with a lot of self-doubt. I constantly feel like I'm not good enough and I'm just not sure how to deal with it.

Psychologist: I understand how that can be really challenging. Is there anything specific that might have triggered these feelings of self-doubt?

Patient: I think it started when I lost my job a few months ago. I've been having a hard time finding a new one, and it's made me question my abilities and worth.

Psychologist: Losing a job can definitely be a blow to one's self-esteem. It's common to experience doubt and uncertainty in such situations. Have you been actively searching for new opportunities?

Patient: Yes, I have been looking for jobs and attending interviews, but the rejections have been quite disheartening.

Psychologist: Rejections can be tough, but it's important to remember that they don't define your worth. It may take some time, but finding the right opportunity will happen. In the meantime, have you considered any coping strategies to help manage your self-doubt?

Patient: I've tried distracting myself with hobbies and spending time with friends, but the negative thoughts always seem to creep back in.

Psychologist: It's good that you're engaging in activities that bring you joy. However, it may also be helpful to challenge those negative thoughts with more positive and realistic ones. Have you noticed any patterns in your thinking that contribute to your self-doubt?

Patient: I often catch myself comparing myself to others and feeling like I don't measure up.

Psychologist: Comparing ourselves to others can be detrimental to our self-esteem. Remember that everyone has their own journey and it's not fair to judge yourself based on someone else's achievements. In our next session, we can explore some techniques to help you reframe those thoughts.

Patient: That would be great, Dr. Smith. I really want to work on improving my self-esteem and finding healthier ways to deal with self-doubt.

Psychologist: I'm glad to hear that, John. Together, we'll explore different strategies and work towards building your self-confidence. In the meantime, I encourage you to be kind to yourself and practice self-care. Remember, you're not alone in this journey.

Patient: Thank you, Dr. Smith. I appreciate your support and guidance.

Psychologist: You're welcome, John. Remember, we're here to figure things out together.
