Person A: Hey 
Person B: Hey, how are you? 
Person A: I'm feeling really overwhelmed lately. 
Person B: I'm here for you. What's been going on? 
Person A: I've been struggling to manage my workload and it's causing a lot of stress. 
Person B: It sounds like you have a lot on your plate. Have you tried breaking it down into smaller tasks? 
Person A: I haven't, but that could be helpful. I think I just get overwhelmed by the big picture. 
Person B: That's completely normal. Taking it one step at a time can make it more manageable. Is there anything else contributing to your stress? 
Person A: Well, I've also been having trouble sleeping. I can't seem to relax at night. 
Person B: Poor sleep can definitely impact your well-being. Have you tried any relaxation techniques before bed? 
Person A: I've tried deep breathing exercises, but they haven't been very effective. 
Person B: It's great that you've already tried something. Maybe we can explore other relaxation techniques together. Have you considered meditation or listening to calming music? 
Person A: I haven't, but I'm willing to give it a try. 
Person B: That's a positive mindset to have. Remember, it's important to be patient with yourself during this process. You're doing great, even if it doesn't feel like it right now.
