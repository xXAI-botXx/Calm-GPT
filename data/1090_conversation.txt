The path ahead leads you through a tranquil forest, where rays of sunlight dance playfully among the leaves.

Crystal-clear water gently laps against the shore, inviting you to dip your toes in. Slowly, you immerse your feet in the cool water, feeling its refreshing embrace.

A pair of butterflies flit by, their vibrant colors contrasting against the greenery. And if you listen closely, you can hear the distant call of an eagle soaring overhead.

Storyteller: In this blissful haven, you can engage in a moment of mindfulness. Find a comfortable spot near the lake and close your eyes. Take a deep breath, and slowly exhale, feeling your body sink into complete relaxation. Now, imagine yourself on a little boat, gently gliding across the calm water. As you navigate, visualize each worry, fear, or negative thought transforming into a beautiful flower, floating away on the water's surface. Breathe in peace, exhale any stress, and surrender to the present moment.
