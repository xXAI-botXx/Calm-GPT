Person A: Hey, are you there?
Person B: Yeah, I'm here. What's up?
Person A: I've been feeling really anxious lately. I'm scared of failing in my upcoming exams.
Person B: I understand how you're feeling, but remember that it's normal to have worries before exams. You've always done well in the past.
Person A: I know, but this time the material is really difficult. I'm afraid I won't be able to understand it.
Person B: Don't doubt yourself. You're intelligent and have always been able to grasp challenging concepts. Plus, you've been studying so much for these exams.
Person A: Yeah, I have been studying a lot, but what if it's not enough?
Person B: It's natural to have that "what if" mentality, but try to focus on the effort you've put in. Trust that your hard work will pay off.
Person A: Okay, I'll try to stay positive and believe in myself. Thanks for the encouragement.
Person B: Anytime! Remember, worrying won't change the outcome. Just stay focused and do your best. You've got this!
