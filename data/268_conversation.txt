Patient: Good morning, doctor.
Psychologist: Good morning. How can I help you today? 
Patient: I've been feeling really anxious lately. I'm constantly worrying about everything. 
Psychologist: I see. Can you tell me what specifically has been causing you anxiety? 
Patient: Well, I have a big presentation at work next week, and I'm afraid of messing it up. I also have been having trouble sleeping because of all the thoughts racing through my mind. 
Psychologist: It sounds like you're under a lot of pressure. Let's explore some coping strategies to help manage your anxiety. Have you tried any relaxation techniques?
Patient: I haven't really tried anything specific. I've been exercising a bit more, but it doesn't seem to calm me down completely. 
Psychologist: That's a good start. In addition to exercise, deep breathing exercises and progressive muscle relaxation can also be beneficial. I can guide you through these techniques if you'd like.
