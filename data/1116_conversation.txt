Person A: Hey 
Person B: Hey, how are you? 
Person A: I'm freaking out, I have this big presentation tomorrow and I'm terrified of public speaking. 
Person B: I understand your fear. Can you tell me more about what specifically scares you? 
Person A: I'm afraid of freezing up, forgetting my lines, and looking like a fool in front of everyone. 
Person B: It's completely normal to feel anxious about presenting. But hey, have you ever thought about the funny side? 
Person A: Funny side? What do you mean? 
Person B: Well, imagine instead of giving a presentation, you're starring in a comedy show! You can improvise and make funny facial expressions. 
Person A: (laughs) That's actually a hilarious way to look at it. 
Person B: Exactly, embrace the possibility of turning it into a humorous performance. It takes the pressure off and helps you focus on entertaining yourself and others. 
Person A: You're right, I should give it a try. Thanks for making me laugh and putting things in perspective. 
Person B: You're welcome! Remember, a little laughter can work wonders in calming our nerves.
