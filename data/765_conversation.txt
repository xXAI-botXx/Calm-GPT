Patient: I've been feeling really down lately. I have no motivation, and I constantly feel sad.
Psychologist: I'm sorry to hear that. How long have you been feeling this way?
Patient: It's been going on for a few months now. I can't seem to shake this feeling, no matter what I do.
Psychologist: Have there been any major changes or events in your life recently that might be contributing to your feelings?

Psychologist: It sounds like you might be experiencing symptoms of depression. Have you considered seeking professional help before now?

Psychologist: I'm glad you reached out. It's important to address these feelings and seek support. Let's start by discussing your symptoms in more detail, so I can better understand your situation.
Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help and look forward to finding some answers.
