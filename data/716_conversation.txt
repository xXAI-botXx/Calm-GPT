Therapist: Good morning! How are you feeling today?

Patient: Hi... I'm feeling really overwhelmed and anxious. I can't seem to relax.

Therapist: I understand how tough that can be. Remember, you're not alone in this. We're here to work through it together. Have you been practicing any of the relaxation techniques we discussed last time?

Patient: Yeah, I've been trying to do some deep breathing exercises, but it's been hard to focus.

Therapist: It's completely normal to struggle at first. Remember, progress takes time. Let's start with a simple exercise right now. Take a deep breath in... hold it... and slowly release it. Try to focus on the sensation of your breath as it enters and leaves your body. 

Patient: (Deep breath) Okay, that felt a bit calmer.

Therapist: That's great! Keep practicing this whenever you feel overwhelmed. I believe in your ability to calm yourself down. Now, let's talk about what's been causing your stress. What specific situations have been triggering your anxiety?

Patient: Well, it's mostly my workload at work. There's just so much to do, and I feel like I'm drowning in tasks.

Therapist: I hear you. Feeling overwhelmed by work-related responsibilities can be extremely stressful. Remember, you're doing your best. Let's break down your workload into smaller, manageable tasks. Take it one step at a time. How can you prioritize your tasks to make it more achievable?

Patient: I guess I could create a to-do list and prioritize the most important tasks first.

Therapist: That's a wonderful idea! By organizing your tasks, you'll have a clearer picture of what needs to be done. And remember, don't hesitate to ask for help or delegate tasks when possible. You don't have to do it all alone. Together, we can find strategies to make your workload more manageable.

Patient: Thank you for your support. It really helps to know that I'm not alone in this.

Therapist: You're welcome! Remember, we're in this together. I believe in your ability to handle this situation and overcome your anxiety. Let's continue building a toolbox of coping strategies that work specifically for you.
