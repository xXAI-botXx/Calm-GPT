Person A: Hey
Person B: Hey, how are you?
Person A: Honestly, not great... I've been feeling really overwhelmed lately.
Person B: I'm sorry to hear that. What specifically has been overwhelming you?
Person A: Work has been really demanding, and I've been struggling to find a good work-life balance.
Person B: I understand how challenging that can be. Have you tried any strategies to improve your work-life balance?
Person A: I've tried setting boundaries, like not working on weekends, but it's hard to stick to them. 
Person B: It can be difficult to maintain boundaries, especially when work demands are high. Have you considered talking to your supervisor about your workload or seeking support from colleagues?
Person A: I haven't yet, but maybe that's a good idea. I just worry about seeming incapable or overwhelmed.
Person B: It's natural to have concerns about how you may be perceived, but advocating for yourself and your needs is important. Remember, everyone has limitations, and it's okay to ask for help or adjustments to manage your workload effectively.
Person A: You're right. I shouldn't be afraid to seek support. Thanks for reminding me of that.
Person B: You're welcome. It's my pleasure to offer guidance and support. Just remember, you don't have to go through this alone. It's okay to reach out and ask for assistance when you need it.
Person A: I will keep that in mind. Thanks for being there for me.
Person B: Anytime. Remember, self-care and support are crucial in maintaining your overall well-being. Take care of yourself, my friend.
