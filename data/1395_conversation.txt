Person A: Hey 
Person B: Hey, how are you? 
Person A: Not so great. I've been feeling really overwhelmed lately. 
Person B: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about what's been going on? 
Person A: Well, work has been really stressful and I'm having trouble balancing everything. I feel like I'm constantly running on empty. 
Person B: It sounds like you've been putting a lot of pressure on yourself. Have you been taking any time for self-care? 
Person A: Not really. I've been so focused on work that I haven't had time for myself. 
Person B: Taking care of yourself is important, especially during stressful times. Is there something you enjoy doing that helps you relax? 
Person A: I used to love painting, but it's been ages since I picked up a brush. 
Person B: Maybe it's time to reconnect with your passion. Painting can be a great outlet for stress. 
Person A: You're right. I need to make time for myself and do something I love. Thanks for reminding me. 
Person B: You're welcome. Remember, taking care of yourself should always be a priority. Let me know if there's anything else I can do to support you.
