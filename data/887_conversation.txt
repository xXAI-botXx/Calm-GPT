Person A: Hey, I've been feeling really anxious lately. I have so many things running through my mind.

Person B: Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. Maybe I can tell you a funny story to distract you. So, one time I was trying to impress a group of friends by attempting a backflip on a trampoline. Can you imagine what happened next?

Person A: Um, what happened?

Person B: Well, let's just say I ended up landing face-first into the trampoline instead of doing a graceful flip. My friends were laughing so hard, it was impossible to feel anything but pure laughter. It was definitely a memorable moment!

Person A: Haha! That's actually really funny. I can't help but laugh. Thanks for sharing that story, it really lifted my spirits a bit.

Person B: You're welcome! Sometimes laughter is the best medicine for our worries. If you ever need more funny stories or distractions, just let me know. I'm here to make you smile!
