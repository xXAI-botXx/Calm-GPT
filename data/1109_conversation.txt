Person A: Hey 
Person B: Hey, how are you? 
Person A: Not that great, actually. I've been feeling really overwhelmed with work lately. 
Person B: I'm sorry to hear that. Have you been taking breaks and practicing self-care? 
Person A: Not really, I've just been pushing through. 
Person B: It's important to remember to take care of yourself too. Maybe try setting aside some time each day for relaxation or doing something you enjoy. 
Person A: Yeah, I guess I've been neglecting that aspect. I'll try to make time for myself. 
Person B: That's great. Remember, your mental well-being is just as important as your work. Is there anything specific that's been causing you stress? 
Person A: It's mostly the increasing workload and feeling like I can't meet the expectations. 
Person B: It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of pressure. Have you talked to your supervisor about how you're feeling? 
Person A: Not yet, I was hoping I could handle it on my own. 
Person B: It's always good to have a support system. Your supervisor might be able to offer guidance or help alleviate some of the workload. 
Person A: You're right, I shouldn't hesitate to ask for help. I'll schedule a meeting with them. 
Person B: That's a positive step forward. Remember, it's okay to reach out for assistance when needed. Is there anything else on your mind? 
Person A: Not at the moment, but I appreciate your support. It means a lot to me. 
Person B: I'm always here to listen and offer advice. Don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything. Take care of yourself, okay? 
Person A: Thank you, I will.
