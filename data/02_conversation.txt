Person B: It sounds like you’re going through a tough time, but remember, just like the ocean, our emotions can ebb and flow. It’s okay to let these feelings wash over you. Don’t fight them, acknowledge them. And remember, just as the tide goes out, so too will these feelings.

Person A: I just don’t know if I can keep going like this.

Person B: I understand how hard it can be. But remember, you’re stronger than you think. You’ve faced challenges before and you’ve overcome them. This is just another challenge that I believe you can overcome. And remember, it’s okay to ask for help. You’re not alone in this.

Person A: I just wish I could stop feeling this way.

Person B: It’s completely normal to want to feel better. And with time and the right support, you will. Remember, it’s okay to take things one day at a time. Try to focus on the things that bring you joy and peace. And remember, it’s okay to take care of yourself. You’re important and your feelings matter.

Person A: Thank you, I’ll try to remember that.

Person B: That’s the spirit! Remember, it’s okay to have bad days. Just know that better days are coming. You’re doing great, and I’m here to support you every step of the way. Keep going, you’ve got this!
