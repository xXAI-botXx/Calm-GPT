Person A: Hey, I wanted to talk to you about something that's been on my mind. 
Person B: Of course! What's bothering you? 
Person A: Well, I have something called Selective Mutism. It's a condition where I find it extremely difficult to speak in certain situations or around certain people. 
Person B: Oh wow, I've heard of that before. Can you tell me a little more about it? When did you first notice it? 
Person A: It started when I was a child, around five years old. I would freeze up and become completely unable to speak in social settings, like at school or at parties. 
Person B: That must have been really challenging. How do you usually feel in those situations? 
Person A: I feel overwhelmed and anxious. It's like my voice gets trapped inside me, and I can't find the courage to let it out. 
Person B: I see. You know, it's great that you opened up to me about this. I want you to know that I'm here to support you. 
Person A: Thank you, that means a lot to me. It's just really hard to explain to people why I can't talk sometimes. 
Person B: I completely understand. It's important to remember that we all have different struggles, and there's no shame in not always being able to express ourselves verbally. Have you tried any techniques to help manage it? 
Person A: I've been working with a therapist who has suggested various strategies, like gradual exposure and relaxation techniques. It's a work in progress, but I'm trying my best. 
Person B: That's wonderful! It takes a lot of courage to take those steps and seek help. I'm proud of you for not giving up. 
Person A: Thank you. Sometimes I worry that people won't be patient with me or will judge me for not speaking. 
Person B: I can understand why you might feel that way, but let me assure you that I'm in your corner. We all have our own unique challenges, and it's important for others to be understanding and accepting. 
Person A: You're right, and it really means a lot to have your support. Thank you for listening and being so positive. 
Person B: Anytime! Remember, we're all here to help each other. You're not alone in this, and together we can find ways to navigate through challenging situations.
