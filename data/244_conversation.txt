Person A: Good afternoon, Dr. Smith. Thank you for seeing me today.
Person B: Good afternoon, Mr. Johnson. How can I assist you today?
Person A: Well, I've been feeling quite overwhelmed lately. I can't seem to shake off this constant feeling of anxiety.
Person B: I see. Can you tell me more about what triggers this anxiety?
Person A: It's mostly related to work. I've been under a lot of pressure lately, and I find it difficult to manage my workload.
Person B: I understand. It sounds like you're experiencing stress due to work-related demands. How long have you been feeling this way?
Person A: It's been going on for a few months now. At first, I thought it was just temporary, but it has started to affect my sleep and overall well-being.
Person B: It's important that you're addressing these symptoms. Have you noticed any other changes in your mood or behavior?
Person A: Sometimes I find myself avoiding social situations, and I've lost interest in activities I used to enjoy. It's like I've lost my motivation.
Person B: These changes in behavior and loss of interest are significant indicators of potential depression. It's important that we further explore your symptoms. Are there any major life events or changes that could have contributed to these feelings?
Person A: Well, my workload did increase significantly after a recent promotion, and I've been struggling to adjust to the new responsibilities.
Person B: I understand. It seems like the combination of work pressure and major life changes might be impacting your mental health. Let's work together to come up with a plan to manage this anxiety and potentially explore ways to cope with the adjustment to your new role.
Person A: That sounds like a good idea. I'm open to any strategies that could help me regain control of my emotions and lessen my anxiety.
Person B: Great. We can start by implementing some relaxation techniques such as deep breathing exercises and mindfulness. Additionally, we can work on setting realistic goals and expectations at work and explore strategies to improve your work-life balance.
Person A: Thank you, Dr. Smith. I appreciate your guidance and support in helping me through this challenging time.
Person B: You're welcome, Mr. Johnson. Remember, you're not alone in this journey, and I'm here to provide the support you need. Let's schedule our next session to monitor your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your treatment plan.
Person A: That sounds good to me. I look forward to our next session. See you then. 
Person B: See you next week, Mr. Johnson. Take care.
