Person A: Hey, I've been feeling really anxious lately.
Person B: Hey, sorry to hear that. What's been triggering your anxiety?
Person A: I think it's a combination of work stress and social situations.
Person B: I understand, those can be tough. Just remember, everyone is mostly focused on themselves and their own things.
Person A: Yeah, that's true. I guess I worry too much about what others think of me.
Person B: It's natural to want to be liked, but try not to let it consume you. You are your own unique person.
Person A: I'll try to keep that in mind. Thanks for reminding me.
Person B: No problem at all, anytime. Remember, it's okay to take breaks and prioritize your mental well-being.
