Person A: Hey
Person B: Hey, how are you feeling today?
Person A: Not so well actually...
Person B: Oh no, what's been bothering you?
Person A: I just lack self-confidence... I doubt my abilities and always worry about what others think of me.
Person B: I understand how that feels. Can you tell me more about what specifically makes you doubt yourself?
Person A: It's mainly my fear of failure. I'm constantly worried that I won't be good enough or that I'll make mistakes.
Person B: I can understand that fear, but remember that making mistakes is a natural part of learning and growing. It doesn't define your worth or competence.
Person A: I know, but it's hard to shake off that feeling.
Person B: I get it. Do you think there are any specific experiences or past events that contributed to this lack of confidence?
Person A: I think it stems from a few instances where I didn't perform as well as I wanted to and received negative feedback.
Person B: It's normal to have setbacks, but those instances don't define your capabilities. Everyone has their off days. Can you think of any positive experiences where you felt confident and achieved success?
Person A: Well, actually there was this one project where I received praise for my work. It made me feel really good about myself.
Person B: That's fantastic! See, you do have the ability to succeed and be confident. It's important to focus on those positive experiences and use them as motivation.
Person A: Yeah, I guess I should try to remember those more often.
Person B: Absolutely! And remember that you're not alone in this journey. Talk to people who believe in you and can offer support and encouragement.
Person A: Thank you for being here to listen and help. It means a lot to me.
Person B: You're welcome! I'm always here to support you. Remember, you're capable of so much more than you think. Don't let self-doubt hold you back.
