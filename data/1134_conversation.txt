Person A: Hey
Person B: Hey, how are you feeling today?
Person A: I'm okay, just feeling a bit down.
Person B: I'm sorry to hear that. Is there something specific bothering you?
Person A: Yeah, I've been feeling overwhelmed with work recently.
Person B: I understand. It's common to feel overwhelmed at times. Have you tried any strategies to manage your workload?
Person A: I've tried making a to-do list, but it doesn't seem to help much.
Person B: Sometimes to-do lists can be overwhelming themselves. Have you considered breaking your tasks into smaller, more manageable steps?
Person A: That's actually a good idea. I'll give it a try.
Person B: Great! Remember to be kind to yourself throughout this process. What else has been going on in your life?
Person A: Well, I've also been having trouble sleeping.
Person B: Lack of sleep can definitely impact our mood. Have you tried creating a bedtime routine to help you unwind before sleep?
Person A: I haven't, but it's worth a shot.
Person B: It might also be helpful to limit screen time before bed and create a calm sleeping environment. Let me know if that helps.
Person A: I will, thank you for your suggestions.
Person B: You're welcome. I'm always here to listen and offer support.
