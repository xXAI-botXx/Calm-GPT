Person A: Hey, can I talk to you about something? I'm feeling really upset and overwhelmed right now.

Person B: Of course, I'm here for you. What's been going on? Take your time, I'm listening.

Person A: Well, my supervisor at work has been constantly criticizing my work lately. It feels like nothing I do is ever good enough. It's been really affecting my self-esteem and I'm starting to question my abilities.

Person B: I'm so sorry to hear that. It sounds like a really difficult situation. It's understandable that you're feeling upset and overwhelmed. You're doing your best, and it's important to remember that this criticism doesn't define your worth or abilities.

Person A: Thank you for saying that. It means a lot to hear your support. Sometimes it's hard to remind myself of that in the moment.

Person B: I completely understand. It's natural to internalize criticism, especially when it's constant. Remember that your worth goes beyond this one job or one person's opinion. Is there anything I can do to support you during this challenging time?

Person A: Honestly, just having someone who listens and shows empathy like you do is incredibly helpful. It's nice to know that I'm not alone in this.

Person B: You're definitely not alone. I'm here for you, no matter what. Remember to take care of yourself and your well-being throughout this process. And don't hesitate to reach out if you need someone to talk to again. You're strong and capable, and I believe in you.

Person A: Thank you so much, that really means a lot to me. I'll try to keep your words in mind and focus on taking care of myself. Your support has made a huge difference for me.
