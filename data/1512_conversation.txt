Storyteller: In the distance, you see the waves gently rolling in, their rhythmic motion bringing a sense of calmness to your mind. Take a moment to observe the waves, how they rise and fall, always in harmony with the currents of the ocean. As you watch, imagine your breath syncing with the ebb and flow of the tides.

Feel the momentary chill as it washes over you, soothing your weary feet. Take another deep breath and imagine your worries and stresses being carried away with each wave that washes back into the ocean.

Storyteller: Ahead of you, a small sandbar emerges, seemingly untouched by the tides. You make your way towards it, feeling the wet sand squish between your toes. As you step onto the sandbar, you notice a gentle breeze blowing across the water, creating ripples that seem to dance to an enchanting melody.

Storyteller: Finding a comfortable spot, you gently sit down and close your eyes. Be aware of the sounds surrounding you - the gentle lapping of the waves, the distant calls of seagulls, and the soft rustling of palm fronds in the breeze. Inhale deeply through your nose, counting to four, hold your breath for a moment, and then exhale slowly through your mouth, counting to eight.

As you slowly open your eyes, carry this feeling of peace and relaxation with you, knowing that you can tap into it whenever you need a moment of respite.
