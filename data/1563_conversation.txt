Person A: Hey 
Person B: Hey, how are you? 
Person A: I'm feeling really anxious and scared right now. 
Person B: I'm here for you. Remember, you are stronger than your fears. Take a deep breath and let's try a little exercise together. Are you ready? 
Person A: Okay, I'll try. 
Person B: Close your eyes and imagine yourself in a beautiful meadow. The sun is shining, and you can hear the gentle sound of a stream. Take a moment to really feel yourself in this peaceful place. 
Person A: I'm starting to feel a little calmer. 
Person B: Great! Now, imagine that you see a box in front of you. This box represents your fears and worries. Visualize yourself picking up that box. As you hold it in your hands, notice how heavy it feels. 
Person A: Yeah, it feels really heavy and overwhelming. 
Person B: Now, take a deep breath, and imagine that you have the power to shrink the box. See it becoming smaller and smaller until it fits in the palm of your hand. The weight also decreases as the box gets smaller. 
Person A: Wow, that's amazing! The box is so tiny now. 
Person B: That's right! You have the ability to manage your fears and worries. Whenever you start to feel anxious, imagine that you're holding that tiny box and remind yourself that you are in control. 
Person A: Thank you so much. I feel empowered and motivated to face my fears.
