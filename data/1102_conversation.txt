Person B: Alright, let's start by finding a quiet and comfortable space. Sit with your back straight and close your eyes.

Person B: Take a deep breath in through your nose, and slowly exhale through your mouth. Repeat this a few times, focusing on the sensation of your breath. 
Person A: (Inhales and exhales) 
Person B: Now, bring your attention to the present moment. Notice any sounds around you, the feeling of your body on the chair, and the sensation of your breath. 
Person A: (Focuses on the present moment) 
Person B: If any anxious thoughts come up, just acknowledge them and let them pass without judgment. Return your focus to the breath. 
Person A: (Acknowledges thoughts and returns focus to breath) 
Person B: Now, imagine a peaceful place in your mind. It could be a beach, a forest, or anywhere that brings you a sense of calm. Picture yourself there, surrounded by tranquility. 
Person A: (Visualizes a peaceful place) 
Person B: Take a few more breaths, feeling the peaceful energy of this place seeping into your body. Allow yourself to relax and let go of any tension. 
Person A: (Breathes deeply and relaxes) 
Person B: Whenever you're ready, slowly open your eyes and come back to the present moment. How do you feel? 
Person A: Wow, that was really calming. I feel much better now. Thank you! 
Person B: I'm glad it helped. Remember, you can always turn to meditation whenever you're feeling anxious. It's a powerful tool for finding peace within yourself.
