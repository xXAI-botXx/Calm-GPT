As you settle onto the cushions, you discover a small wooden table nearby, adorned with a teapot, cups, and a plate of warm honey tea and buttery biscuits.

User: Mmm, it sounds delightful. What do I see outside the cabin?
Storyteller: Through the large windows, you catch glimpses of the vast forest beyond. The trees are bathed in hues of gold, crimson, and the richest shades of orange. The sunlight filters through the leaves, creating a dappled tapestry on the forest floor. Take a deep breath and allow yourself to imagine the crisp scent of the pine trees.
