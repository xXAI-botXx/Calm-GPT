Person A: Hey
Person B: Hi there, how are you feeling today?
Person A: I'm really scared right now, I keep having panic attacks.
Person B: I understand that it can be overwhelming, but remember, you're not alone in this. We'll find a way to get through it together.
Person A: It's just so hard to control my thoughts and feelings.
Person B: I completely get it, and it's okay to feel scared. But let's try focusing on what we can control. Take a deep breath with me. Inhale...and exhale. You're doing great.
Person A: (deep breath) Okay, that actually helped a bit.
Person B: That's the spirit! You're stronger than you think. Remember, you've overcome challenges before, and you can do it again.
Person A: I'm just worried it'll never get better.
Person B: It might feel that way now, but it's important to keep a positive mindset. Progress takes time, and each step forward is worth celebrating. You've got this.
Person A: Thank you for being here for me. It means a lot.
Person B: I'm always here for you, no matter what. We'll work through this together, one day at a time.
