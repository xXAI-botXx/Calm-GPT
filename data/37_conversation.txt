Person A: I can't believe this! I'm so angry right now. 
Person B: It sounds like you're really upset. Let's talk about what's going on. 
Person A: I just found out that my co-worker took credit for my idea at work. It's not fair! 
Person B: That must be really frustrating to see someone else take credit for your hard work. It's completely understandable that you're feeling angry. 
Person A: Yeah, it's just so infuriating! I put in so much effort and now someone else is getting all the recognition. 
Person B: I hear you. It's natural to feel angry in a situation like this. Your feelings are valid and important. 
Person A: Thank you for saying that. It means a lot to me. I just don't know how to handle this situation without losing my cool. 
Person B: It's completely normal to feel angry, but it's important to find constructive ways to express it. How about we brainstorm some strategies together? 
Person A: That would be great. Maybe I can talk to my supervisor and provide evidence of my contributions to the idea. 
Person B: That sounds like a good plan. It's important to advocate for yourself and make sure your hard work doesn't go unnoticed. Remember, I'm here to support you through this process.
