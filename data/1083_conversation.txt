Person A: Hey 
Person B: Hey, how are you? 
Person A: Not so great actually. I've been feeling really anxious lately. 
Person B: I'm sorry to hear that. What's been causing your anxiety? 
Person A: I think it's mostly work-related stress. I've been feeling overwhelmed and constantly worry about not meeting deadlines. 
Person B: It sounds like you're putting a lot of pressure on yourself. Have you considered talking to your manager about your workload? 
Person A: I've thought about it, but I'm afraid they won't understand or think I'm not capable of handling it all. 
Person B: It's important to communicate your concerns and limitations. Your manager may be more understanding than you think. Alternatively, is there someone else you could delegate some tasks to? 
Person A: That's a good point. I'll try talking to my manager and see if there's a possibility of delegating some tasks. 
Person B: Great, I think that could help alleviate some of the stress. Remember, it's okay to ask for help when you need it. 
Person A: Thank you for the advice. I really appreciate your support. 
Person B: You're welcome. Just know that I'm here for you whenever you need someone to talk to.
