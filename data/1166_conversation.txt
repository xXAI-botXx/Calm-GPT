Therapist: Hey there! How are you feeling today?
Patient: Hey. I'm feeling really overwhelmed and anxious.
Therapist: I'm sorry to hear that. Remember, you're not alone in this. What's been going on lately that's been causing your stress?
Patient: Work has been really demanding, and I'm worried I won't be able to handle it all.
Therapist: It's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed. Take a deep breath. Let's break down your tasks into smaller, manageable steps. What's the first thing you can do to start tackling your workload?
Patient: I guess I can make a to-do list and prioritize my tasks.
Therapist: That's a great idea! By breaking things down and prioritizing, you'll feel less overwhelmed. Remember to acknowledge your accomplishments along the way. Celebrate even the small victories!
Patient: I'll try to keep that in mind. It's just hard to see the progress sometimes.
Therapist: It's completely normal to feel that way, but it's important to focus on the progress you've made. What's one thing you can do today, no matter how small, to bring you closer to your goals?
Patient: Maybe I can start by completing one of the smaller tasks on my list.
Therapist: Fantastic! That's a great way to build momentum. Once you've completed that task, take a moment to acknowledge your progress and give yourself a pat on the back. You're doing great!
Patient: Thank you for your support. It means a lot to me.
Therapist: It's my pleasure! I'm here to support you every step of the way. Remember, you're strong and capable of overcoming any challenges that come your way. Keep going!
Patient: I will try my best.
