Person A: Hey, I'm freaking out! I have a major work deadline tomorrow and I haven't even started yet!

Person B: Hey, calm down. I have an idea to distract you. How about a quick game of Sudoku?

Person A: Ugh, I don't think I have time for games right now.

Person B: Trust me, taking a short break to clear your mind will actually help you focus better. Just give it a try!

Person A: Fine, I guess it can't hurt. Let's do it!

Person B: Great! Here's an easy puzzle for you to start. Fill in the numbers so that each row, column, and 3x3 box contains all the numbers from 1 to 9 without repetition.

1 2 3 | 4 5 6 | 7 8 9
4 5 6 |       |        
7 8 9 | 1 2 3 |        
----------------------------
      | 4 5 6 | 7 8 9  
      | 7 8 9 | 1 2 3  
      | 1 2 3 | 4 5 6  
----------------------------
2 3 4 | 5 6 7 | 8 9 1  
5 6 7 |       | 2 3 4  
8 9 1 | 2 3 4 | 5 6 7  

Person A: Okay, I filled in a few numbers but I'm stuck.

Person B: Don't worry, let's work through it together. Look at the empty spaces and think about which numbers can fit there based on the filled-in numbers in the same row, column, and box.

Person A: I think I see it now! Thanks for your help. This is actually quite relaxing.

Person B: See, I told you! Sometimes a little distraction and logic puzzle can do wonders for relieving stress. Keep going, you're almost there!
