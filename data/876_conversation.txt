Patient: Good afternoon, Dr. Smith. Thank you for seeing me today. 
Psychologist: Good afternoon, Mr. Johnson. My pleasure, how can I help you? 
Patient: Well, I've been feeling really down lately. I can't seem to shake off this constant sadness. 
Psychologist: I see. When did you start feeling this way? 
Patient: It's been going on for about two months now. I've lost interest in things I used to enjoy, and it's affecting my work and relationships. 
Psychologist: It sounds like you're experiencing symptoms of depression. Have you noticed any other changes or physical symptoms? 
Patient: Yes, I've been having trouble sleeping. I either can't fall asleep at night or wake up multiple times during the night. I've also been losing my appetite. 
Psychologist: These are common symptoms of depression. Have you experienced any major life changes or stressful events recently that could be contributing to your feelings? 
Patient: I did lose my job a few months ago, which was a big blow. But even before that, I've been feeling this way. 
Psychologist: Losing a job can certainly be a triggering event for depression. However, it seems like there might be underlying factors as well. I would recommend exploring these further in our sessions. 
Patient: That makes sense. I'm open to understanding what might be causing this and finding ways to cope. 
Psychologist: Great. We can start by setting some goals for therapy, such as identifying triggers, developing coping mechanisms, and gradually improving your mood. How does that sound? 
Patient: That sounds like a plan. I'm willing to put in the effort to get better. 
Psychologist: Perfect. We'll work together to develop a treatment plan tailored to your needs. Remember, you're not alone in this, and I'm here to support you every step of the way.
