Imagine, if you will, a massive structure standing tall, piercing the sky with its majestic spires. The sunlight dances through its stained glass windows, casting a kaleidoscope of colors onto the stone floor. Take a deep breath and let your mind wander into this peaceful sanctuary.

Storyteller: Wonderful! As you breathe in, imagine the scent of ageless wisdom within those ancient stone walls. Exhale, releasing any tension or worries that may burden you. Picture yourself approaching the cathedral's entrance, and as you step inside, feel a gentle hush envelop you. The air is cool, carrying with it centuries of whispered prayers and sacred chants.
