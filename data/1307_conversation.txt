Person A: Hey
Person B: Hey, how are you?
Person A: Not so great actually.
Person B: I'm here for you. What's been going on?
Person A: I've been feeling really overwhelmed lately.
Person B: That's understandable. What specifically is overwhelming you?
Person A: Work has been piling up and I feel like I can't keep up with it all.
Person B: It sounds like you're feeling a lot of pressure. Have you tried breaking down your tasks into smaller, more manageable steps?
Person A: Not really, I guess I've just been avoiding it because it feels like too much.
Person B: Avoidance can be tempting, but facing the tasks head-on might help relieve some of that overwhelm. Would you like some help in organizing your to-do list?
Person A: That would be great, thank you.
Person B: Let's start by prioritizing your tasks. What are the most urgent ones?
Person A: I have a report due tomorrow and a client meeting in two days.
Person B: Okay, let's focus on those first. Once you've completed those, we can work on the rest of the tasks together. Remember, taking things one step at a time can make it feel more manageable.
Person A: I'll try to tackle them one by one. Thanks for your support.
Person B: You're welcome. Remember, I'm here for you whenever you need someone to talk to. You've got this.
