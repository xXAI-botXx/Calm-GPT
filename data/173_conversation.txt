Patient: Hello, Dr. Smith. Thank you for seeing me today.
Psychologist: Of course, how can I assist you?
Patient: Well, I've been feeling really overwhelmed lately. I'm having trouble sleeping and focusing on anything.
Psychologist: I see. Can you tell me if there's anything specific that might be causing this overwhelming feeling?
Patient: I recently started a new job, and the workload has been quite demanding. I feel like I can't keep up, and it's affecting my personal life too.
Psychologist: It sounds like work-related stress is a significant factor here. Have you noticed any physical symptoms, such as headaches or fatigue?
Patient: Yes, I've been experiencing frequent headaches and a constant feeling of exhaustion.
Psychologist: Okay, let's explore some strategies to manage your stress levels. Have you tried any relaxation techniques, like deep breathing or meditation?
Patient: I've tried deep breathing before, but I haven't really stuck to a consistent practice. Maybe I should give meditation a try.
Psychologist: That could be a good idea. Meditation can help you calm your mind and reduce stress. Additionally, it may be helpful to establish a routine and set some boundaries at work to ensure a better work-life balance. How does that sound to you?
Patient: It sounds like a plan. I'll start by setting some boundaries at work and dedicating some time each day for meditation. Hopefully, that will help me feel more in control.
Psychologist: Great, I think those steps will definitely make a difference. Remember, it's important to prioritize self-care and give yourself permission to take a break when needed. We can also schedule regular sessions to check-in on your progress and make any necessary adjustments. 
Patient: Thank you, Dr. Smith. I appreciate your guidance and support.
Psychologist: You're very welcome. Remember, I'm here to help you through this process. Don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything between our sessions. Take care.
