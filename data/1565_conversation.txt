Person A: Hey, can I talk to you about something?

Person B: Of course, what's on your mind?

Person A: I've been feeling really anxious lately. It's been overwhelming.

Person B: I'm sorry to hear that. Is there anything specific causing your anxiety?

Person A: It's just everything, really. School, work, relationships. It's like I can't escape it.

Person B: I understand how overwhelming that can be. Remember, everyone is focused on their own lives and problems. They're not analyzing your every move.

Person A: Yeah, you're right. I need to remind myself of that more often.

Person B: Exactly. People are generally self-focused and consumed by their own thoughts. They're not judging you as much as you might think.

Person A: That's comforting to hear. I guess I tend to forget that.

Person B: It's easy to get caught up in our own minds. But try to remember that everyone has their own worries and insecurities.

Person A: You're right. I shouldn't let my anxiety take control of my life.

Person B: Absolutely. Take it one step at a time and focus on what you can control. And remember, it's okay to ask for help when you need it.

Person A: Thank you for reminding me of that. It means a lot to have someone to talk to.

Person B: Anytime. I'm here for you whenever you need to chat or vent.

Person A: I appreciate it. It really helps to know that I'm not alone in this.
