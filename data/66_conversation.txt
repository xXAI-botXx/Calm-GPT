Person A: I can't breathe! I'm having a panic attack!

Person B: Take a deep breath. Let's calm down together. Now, tell me, what are the first three words that come to your mind right now?

Person A: Uh, heart, racing, and dark.

Person B: Imagine this: You are in the middle of a race, running with all your might, feeling your heart pounding as you make your way towards the finish line. The sun has already set, and as you sprint through the darkness, suddenly, you see a glimmer of light in the distance. You run faster, drawn towards it, until you reach a beautiful garden filled with glowing, neon flowers. Their vibrant colors light up the night, and you can't help but feel a sense of calm wash over you. You take a seat on a bench, surrounded by the magical scene, and slowly, your heart rate begins to normalize.

Person A: (laughs) I can actually picture that! It's like a fairytale!

Person B: Exactly! Our minds have the power to take us to incredible places, even in the midst of panic. Remember, just like in this story, you have the strength and resilience to overcome any challenge that comes your way.
