Storyteller: Now, take a seat on a moss-covered rock near the stream. As you settle down, let's shift our attention to your sense of sight. In front of you is a small meadow filled with vibrant wildflowers of all colors. Picture a field of sunflowers swaying gently in the breeze, their golden petals stretching towards the sky. How does this colorful scene make you feel?
