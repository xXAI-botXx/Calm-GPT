It's a rhythmic and soothing sound, like a lullaby that puts your mind at ease. The wind carries the delicate melody of birds singing, their sweet tunes blending harmoniously with the balloon's soft whispers.

A group of children joyfully runs through the meadow, their laughter carried up to your ears. The tranquility of the scene puts your mind at ease, filling you with a sense of peace and contentment.
