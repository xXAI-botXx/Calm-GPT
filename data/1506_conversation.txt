Person A: Hey
Person B: Hey, how are you?
Person A: Not so great, I've been feeling really anxious lately.
Person B: I'm sorry to hear that. Are you okay? 
Person A: I have Panic Disorder, so I've been having frequent panic attacks.
Person B: I'm here for you. What triggers your panic attacks?
Person A: It can happen anytime and anywhere, but crowded places and enclosed spaces really set me off.
Person B: I see. Is there anything specific that helps you calm down during a panic attack?
Person A: Deep breathing and reminding myself that it's just temporary can sometimes help.
Person B: That's good to know. Is there anything I can do to support you?
Person A: Just being there and understanding means a lot. Thank you.
Person B: Of course, that's what friends are for. Do you have any techniques you use to manage your anxiety on a daily basis?
Person A: Regular exercise and sticking to a routine seem to help, but it's an ongoing struggle.
Person B: It's great that you're actively trying to manage it. Have you tried any relaxation techniques, like meditation or yoga?
Person A: I have tried meditation, but I haven't explored yoga yet. Maybe I should give it a shot.
Person B: It might be worth a try. Just remember, it's okay to take it one step at a time. You're doing amazing already.
Person A: Thanks for being so understanding and supportive. It means a lot to me.
Person B: You're welcome! I'm always here for you, through the good times and the bad.
