Person A: I'm really anxious about what's going to happen. I can't stop thinking about the future and it's making me so worried.
Person B: It's okay to feel anxious, but try not to get consumed by it. Remember that everything will be fine in the end.
Person A: But how can I not think about the future? It's all unknown, and that's what scares me the most.
Person B: I understand your fear, but worrying won't change anything, especially for things that are out of your control. Instead, try to focus on the present moment.
Person A: But what if something goes wrong? I can't help but think about all the possible negative outcomes.
Person B: It's important to remember that worrying about the future won't prevent bad things from happening. Accept the feeling of anxiety, acknowledge it, but try not to let it consume you.
Person A: I suppose you're right. It's just so hard to let go of the what-ifs.
Person B: I know it's difficult, but try to redirect your thoughts towards positive outcomes instead. Trust that things will work out and remember that you have the strength to overcome any challenges that may come your way.
Person A: Thank you for being here and reminding me to stay calm. I appreciate your support.
Person B: You're welcome. Take a deep breath, focus on the present, and remember that this feeling of anxiety won't last forever. You'll get through this and things will be better soon.
