Patient: Good morning, Dr. Johnson. How are you today?

Psychologist: Good morning, Mr. Smith. I'm doing well, thank you. How can I help you today?

Patient: Well, I've been feeling quite anxious lately. I've been having trouble sleeping and I constantly feel on edge. 

Psychologist: I see. Can you tell me if there's been anything specific that's been causing you to feel this way?

Patient: I think it might be work-related stress. I've been feeling overwhelmed with the workload and trying to meet deadlines. 

Psychologist: It sounds like you're under a lot of pressure. Have you spoken to your supervisor about this?

Patient: I haven't yet, but I definitely need to address it. I just don't want to seem incapable of handling my responsibilities. 

Psychologist: It's important to take care of your mental health, Mr. Smith. Seeking support doesn't show weakness but rather self-awareness. I suggest you have an open conversation with your supervisor and see if there's a way to balance your workload. 

Patient: That makes sense. I just need to gather the courage to talk about it. 

Psychologist: It's completely normal to feel apprehensive, but remember that you deserve support. Additionally, I can provide strategies to help you cope with anxiety and stress. 

Patient: Thank you, Dr. Johnson. I appreciate your guidance. I will speak to my supervisor and make an appointment with you to learn those coping strategies. 

Psychologist: You're welcome, Mr. Smith. I'm here to support you. Let's schedule an appointment for next week to discuss coping strategies and any other concerns you may have. 

Patient: That sounds great. Thank you, Dr. Johnson. See you next week. 

Psychologist: You're welcome, Mr. Smith. Take care and see you soon.
