Person A: Oh no, I'm so panicked right now! I have this huge problem at work and I don't know how to handle it!

Person B: Hey, take a deep breath and try to calm down. What's the problem?

Person A: Well, my boss just assigned me a super important project with such a tight deadline. I'm afraid I won't be able to finish it on time.

Person B: I understand that it can be overwhelming, but don't let the panic take over. How about we play a little game to distract you and clear your mind?

Person A: Hmm, I don't know. Will it really help?

Person B: Trust me, sometimes a little distraction can work wonders. Let's play a quick round of "Would You Rather." I'll ask you some fun, lighthearted questions and you have to choose between two options. It'll take your mind off things for a while.

Person A: Alright, let's give it a try. I could really use a mental break.

Person B: Great! Here's the first question: Would you rather have the ability to fly or be able to become invisible?

Person A: Hmm, tough one. I guess I'd choose the ability to fly. It would be so liberating and I could escape all my current worries.

Person B: Good choice! Now, the next question: Would you rather have a never-ending supply of pizza or chocolate?

Person A: Oh, that's a tricky one. But I'm a huge pizza lover, so I'll go with a never-ending supply of pizza!

Person B: Excellent choice! Alright, let's finish with one last question: Would you rather live in space or underwater?

Person A: Wow, that's a tough one. Both seem fascinating, but I think I'd choose to live underwater. It would be like exploring a whole new world.

Person B: Awesome! You did great! See, focusing on something fun can help reduce your panic and put things into perspective. Now, take a few more deep breaths and let's tackle your work problem together. We'll come up with a plan that will help you handle the project effectively.
