Patient: Good morning, Dr. Smith. 
Psychologist: Good morning, John. How are you feeling today? 
Patient: I've been feeling really down lately. I don't have any motivation to do anything anymore. 
Psychologist: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about what's been going on? 
Patient: Well, I lost my job a few months ago and ever since then, I've felt like a failure. I can't seem to find any new opportunities and it's really affecting my self-esteem. 
Psychologist: Losing a job can be a difficult experience. It's understandable that it's taking a toll on your self-esteem. Have you been actively searching for new job prospects? 
Patient: I have been, but I keep getting rejected or receiving no response at all. It's making me doubt my abilities and worth. 
Psychologist: It's important to remember that rejection is a common part of the job search process. Many people face setbacks along the way. Have you considered looking for support in enhancing your job search skills? 
Patient: I've thought about it, but I'm not sure where to start. 
Psychologist: I can help guide you in developing effective job search strategies. We can work on improving your resume, practicing interview skills, and exploring potential networking opportunities. How does that sound? 
Patient: That would be great, actually. I could really use some guidance. 
Psychologist: Wonderful. Let's start by setting some realistic goals and breaking them down into smaller, manageable steps. We'll work together to regain your confidence, John. 
Patient: Thank you, Dr. Smith. I appreciate your support. 
Psychologist: You're welcome, John. Remember, you're not alone in this. I'm here to assist you every step of the way.
