Patient: Good morning, Dr. Smith. Thank you for seeing me today.
Psychologist: Good morning, Mr. Johnson. It's my pleasure. How are you feeling today?
Patient: Honestly, I've been feeling quite down lately. I've been experiencing a lot of sadness and loss of interest in things I used to enjoy.
Psychologist: I see. When did these feelings start?
Patient: It's been going on for a few months now. I can't pinpoint exactly when it started, but it has been getting worse over time.
Psychologist: Have there been any significant life events or changes that might have contributed to these feelings?
Patient: Well, my parents recently got divorced, and that has affected me quite a bit. I've also been under a lot of stress at work.
Psychologist: I understand. It's not uncommon for major life changes and stressors to impact our emotional well-being. How have these feelings been affecting your daily life?
Patient: I've been having trouble sleeping, and I've lost my appetite. I find it really difficult to concentrate, and I've been withdrawing from social activities.
Psychologist: I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like you're experiencing symptoms of depression. Have you felt this way before?
Patient: Yes, a few years ago I went through a similar period of feeling down. I sought therapy at that time, and it helped me quite a bit.
Psychologist: That's good to hear. Therapy can be very beneficial in managing depression. Would you be open to trying it again?
Patient: Yes, I think I would. I had a positive experience with therapy in the past, and I'm willing to give it another try to help improve my current situation.
Psychologist: Great. I think it would be helpful for you to start therapy sessions with me. We can work together to explore your emotions, develop coping strategies, and ultimately help you feel better.
Patient: That sounds like a plan, Dr. Smith. I appreciate your support, and I'm looking forward to starting therapy with you.
Psychologist: Thank you, Mr. Johnson. I'm here to support you every step of the way. We will work together towards your well-being.
