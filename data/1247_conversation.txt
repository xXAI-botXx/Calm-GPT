Storyteller: Ah, a treehouse! What a delightful whimsy it brings to our minds. Picture a serene forest bathed in the golden hues of a setting sun. Tall trees sway gently in the breeze, as if inviting us to come closer. As we approach, we notice a magical treehouse nestled amongst the branches of an ancient oak tree.

The soft glow of lanterns beneath the windows beckons us to step inside. Before we do, let us take a moment to breathe deeply.
