Close your eyes and take a deep breath in, feeling your body relax as we delve into the world of clouds. Are you ready?

Person A: Yes, I am ready.

Person B: Good. Now imagine yourself standing in an open field, surrounded by nature's blanket of green. As you look up, you see a clear blue sky stretching out in every direction. Take a deep breath in and feel the warmth of the sun on your skin, as if it's hugging you gently.

Person A: *breathes in deeply*

Person B: Now, as you exhale, imagine a soft, fluffy cloud forming directly above you. It's like a cotton candy floating in the sky. Take a few moments to observe its shape, texture, and color. Let the cloud absorb any worries or stress you may be carrying, as it has the amazing power to bring you solace.

It's as if the wind is inviting you to follow the cloud on its journey through the sky. Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, imagine yourself effortlessly floating up into the air, alongside the cloud.

The worries and stresses of everyday life begin to fade away, and all that remains is the feeling of tranquility. Look down and see how your perspective has changed. It's alright to let go, to surrender to the peacefulness of this moment. Take another deep breath in, and as you exhale, release any tension you might still be holding onto.

Person A: *breathes in and exhales, letting go*
