As you step onto this path, you enter a tunnel of light that gently transports you to another time in your past. The light embraces you, making you feel secure and content.

Take a deep breath, feeling the air filling your lungs, and exhale slowly, letting go of any tension or worries that may have surfaced. Open your eyes, knowing that the past holds beautiful memories, and the present is an opportunity to create new ones.
