User: Rainforest.

Storyteller: Ah, the mesmerizing rainforest! Close your eyes and take a deep breath, inhaling the pure, oxygen-rich air. Imagine yourself standing at the edge of a dense, lush green canopy. Can you feel a gentle mist caressing your skin?

User: Yes, I can feel it.

Storyteller: As you continue to breathe deeply, allow your thoughts to wander. Picture yourself stepping cautiously into the rainforest, your feet sinking into the soft, damp earth. The sounds of nature surround you, a symphony of bird songs, rustling leaves, and buzzing insects.

User: I can hear them all.

Storyteller: As you venture deeper, you notice rays of golden sunlight peeking through the thick canopy, casting dappled patterns on the forest floor. Take a moment to find your own ray of sunlight. Breathe in as you count to four, and exhale as you count to four, allowing any tension to melt away with each breath.
