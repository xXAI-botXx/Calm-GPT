Person A: I take a deep breath, letting go of any tension or worries. What can I do to further immerse myself in this calming environment?

Person B: Find a comfortable spot to sit near the pond, perhaps under a tall willow tree. Close your eyes, and focus on your breath. Inhale slowly, counting to four, feeling the air fill your lungs. Hold your breath for a moment, and then exhale, counting to four again, releasing any remaining stress or tension with each breath.

Person A: (Sighs) I feel a deep sense of calmness washing over me. Can you share one last element of this mythical temple?
