Person A: Not really, I don't want to burden anyone with my problems.
Person B: It's important to remember that you don't have to go through this alone. Talking to someone you trust can provide you with support and new perspectives. Have you considered reaching out to a close friend or family member?
Person A: I haven't really thought about it, but maybe it's worth a try.
