Person A: Hey
Person B: Hey, how are you?
Person A: I'm feeling really overwhelmed lately.
Person B: I understand. Can you tell me more about what's been going on?
Person A: I have a lot of things going on at work, and it feels like I can never catch up. I'm constantly stressed and exhausted.
Person B: It sounds like you're dealing with a heavy workload. Have you tried talking to your manager about it?
Person A: Yeah, I have, but they don't seem to understand the pressure I'm experiencing. They just keep piling on more tasks.
Person B: That must be frustrating. Have you considered speaking with a career counselor to explore options for managing your workload?
Person A: I haven't thought about that. Maybe it's worth looking into. Thanks for the suggestion.
Person B: You're welcome. Remember, it's important to prioritize your well-being. Your mental and emotional health should come first.
Person A: True. I've been neglecting self-care lately. I think I'll take some time off to recharge.
Person B: That sounds like a good plan. Take the time you need to rest and rejuvenate. And don't hesitate to reach out if you need someone to talk to.
Person A: Thanks, I appreciate your support. It means a lot to me.
Person B: Of course, I'm here to help. Take care of yourself, and remember, you've got this.
Person A: Thank you, you're an amazing friend.
