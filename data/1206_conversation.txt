Person A: Hey
Person B: Hey, how are you?
Person A: I'm feeling really down today.
Person B: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me what's been going on?
Person A: I had a fight with my best friend and now we're not speaking to each other.
Person B: That sounds tough. How are you coping with the situation?
Person A: I've been feeling really lonely without them and it's affecting my mood.
Person B: It's completely normal to feel that way after a falling out. Have you tried reaching out to them to discuss what happened?
Person A: I've tried, but they're not responding to my messages.
Person B: It might take some time for things to cool off. In the meantime, have you been doing anything to take care of yourself?
Person A: I've been trying to distract myself by watching movies and going for walks.
Person B: That's really good. Taking care of yourself is important during difficult times. Is there anything else you think might help you feel better?
Person A: I think talking to someone about it is helping. It's nice to be able to vent and have someone listen.
Person B: I'm glad I could be here for you. Remember, it's okay to feel sad, but it won't last forever. Let's hope things improve with your friend soon.
Person A: Thank you for your support. It means a lot to me.
Person B: You're welcome. Just remember, you're not alone in this. I'm here for you.
