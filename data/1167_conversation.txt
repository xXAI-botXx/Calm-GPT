Person A: Hey
Person B: Hey, how are you?
Person A: I'm really scared right now. I'm having a panic attack.
Person B: I understand. Take a deep breath and try to focus on your breathing. You're going to be okay.
Person A: It's so hard to breathe. What if something bad happens?
Person B: I know it feels overwhelming right now, but remember that panic attacks are temporary. What you're feeling is your body's response to fear, but it's not dangerous.
Person A: I just can't calm down. What if I lose control?
Person B: I want you to remember that you're in control of your thoughts and actions. Panic attacks might make you feel out of control, but they can't harm you. It's just your body's way of reacting to stress.
Person A: I feel like I'm going crazy.
Person B: I assure you, you're not going crazy. Panic attacks can make you feel that way, but it's important to remind yourself that you're still the same rational person you've always been. Your thoughts are just being influenced by the panic.
Person A: Will it ever go away?
Person B: Yes, it will. Panic attacks can be managed and treated. You're not alone in this, and I'm here to support you through it. Remember, this feeling is temporary, and you will feel better soon.
Person A: Thank you for being here for me.
Person B: Of course, I'm here anytime you need to talk. You're strong, and you will get through this. Focus on taking slow deep breaths and remember that you are not alone in this journey.
