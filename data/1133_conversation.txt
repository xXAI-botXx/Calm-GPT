Person A: Hey, are you busy right now?
Person B: No, what's up?
Person A: I've been feeling really anxious lately. I don't know what to do.
Person B: Take a deep breath. Inhale slowly for four seconds, hold it for four seconds, and exhale for four seconds. Repeat this a few times.
Person A: Okay, I'll give it a try.
Person B: How are you feeling now?
Person A: It actually helped a bit. I feel a little calmer.
Person B: That's great! Remember, deep breathing can be a helpful tool whenever you start feeling anxious.
