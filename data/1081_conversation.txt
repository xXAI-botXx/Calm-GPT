Person A: Hey, I've been feeling really stressed lately.
Person B: Aw, I'm sorry to hear that. What's been going on?
Person A: I've got so much work to do and deadlines are approaching. I feel overwhelmed.
Person B: I totally understand. Remember that time we were studying for that huge exam and you accidentally wrote "hamster" instead of "history" in your notes? We couldn't stop laughing!
Person A: Haha, oh man! That was hilarious. Thanks for reminding me of that. It's good to take a break and have a laugh sometimes.
