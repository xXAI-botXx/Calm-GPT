Person B: Take deep breaths and try to calm down. It's going to be okay.
Person A: I can't seem to control my breathing, it's getting worse.
Person B: Focus on your breath and try some breathing exercises. Inhale slowly for 4 seconds, hold for 4 seconds, and exhale for 4 seconds. Repeat this until you feel calmer.
Person A: Okay, I'll give it a try.
Person B: Good. Remember, you're in control and this feeling will pass.
