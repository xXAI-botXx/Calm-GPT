Person A: Not really, I feel guilty whenever I take time for myself.
Person B: It's important to remember that self-care is not selfish. Taking care of your well-being is crucial for your overall health and ability to manage stress. What activities do you enjoy that can help you relax?
Person A: I used to enjoy painting, but I haven't had time for it recently.
