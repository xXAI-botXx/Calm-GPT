Person B: I understand how you feel. But remember, everyone has fears and doubts sometimes. You are capable and talented in your own unique way.

Person B: It's natural to want to please others, but the most important thing is to be true to yourself. As long as you do your best, that's what truly matters.

Person A: I'm afraid of taking risks because I'm scared of making mistakes.
