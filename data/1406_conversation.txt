Person A: Hey
Person B: Hey, how are you?
Person A: Not doing so great, honestly.
Person B: I'm sorry to hear that. What's been bothering you?
Person A: I've been feeling really overwhelmed with work lately.
Person B: It sounds like you're under a lot of pressure. How has it been affecting you?
Person A: I've been having trouble sleeping and I constantly feel on edge.
Person B: It's understandable given the circumstances. Have you tried any relaxation techniques to help manage stress?
Person A: I've tried deep breathing exercises, but they don't seem to help much.
Person B: Have you considered incorporating some form of physical activity into your routine? It can be a great stress reliever.
Person A: I used to exercise regularly, but I haven't had the time lately.
Person B: It might be worth carving out a small window in your day just for yourself. Exercise can really make a difference in managing stress levels. 
Person A: You're right, I should make it a priority. Thanks for the advice.
Person B: Of course, anytime. Remember, taking care of yourself is just as important as your work. Let me know if you need any additional support.
