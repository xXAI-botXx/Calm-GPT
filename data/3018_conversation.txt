Storyteller: Ah, carnival! A time of joy, laughter, and colorful festivities. Picture yourself in a small, picturesque coastal town. The air is filled with the delightful aroma of cotton candy and freshly popped popcorn. Can you hear the faint sound of cheerful music playing in the distance?

User: It's heartwarming to see the joy on their faces.
