Person A: Hey 
Person B: Hey, how are you feeling today? 
Person A: Not so good, to be honest. I'm feeling really scared of failing. 
Person B: Oh no! What's making you feel this way? 
Person A: I have this important presentation tomorrow and I'm worried I'll mess it up. 
Person B: I understand your concern, but have you prepared well for it? 
Person A: Yes, I've been practicing a lot, but what if I freeze up in front of everyone? 
Person B: That's completely normal. Just take deep breaths and remind yourself of your hard work and preparation. 
Person A: Yeah, you're right. It's just hard not to think about all the things that could go wrong. 
Person B: I get that, but what if instead you focus on what could go right? Visualize yourself confidently delivering the presentation and receiving positive feedback. 
Person A: I haven't thought about it that way. I should try to reframe my mindset. 
Person B: Definitely! And remember, even if things don't go perfectly, it doesn't mean you're a failure. It's all about learning and growing. 
Person A: You're right. Failure doesn't define me. Thank you for helping me see things differently. 
Person B: Hey, no problem! I'm always here to support you. You've got this! 
Person A: Thanks for believing in me. It means a lot. 
Person B: Anytime! Just remember to have confidence in yourself. Good luck with the presentation! 
Person A: Thanks, I'll do my best.
