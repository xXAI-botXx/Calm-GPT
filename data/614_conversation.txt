Patient: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me today.
Psychologist: Good morning. It's my pleasure. How are you feeling today?
Patient: I've been feeling quite anxious lately. I find it difficult to relax and have been having trouble sleeping.
Psychologist: I see. When did this anxiety start? Can you pinpoint any specific triggers?
Patient: It started about two weeks ago, after I had a major deadline at work. Since then, I constantly worry about whether I did a good job. I also have this nagging feeling that something bad will happen.
Psychologist: It sounds like you may be experiencing work-related stress and a generalized anxiety. Have you noticed any physical symptoms accompanying your anxiety?
Patient: Yes, I've been having frequent headaches, my heart sometimes races, and I often feel a tightness in my chest.
Psychologist: Those are common physical symptoms of anxiety. It's important to address this before it worsens. In addition to your work stress, have you experienced any other significant life events recently that might contribute to your anxiety?
Patient: Well, my relationship ended a few months ago, and I'm still struggling with the loss. I think that, combined with work stress, has made everything feel overwhelming for me.
Psychologist: It's understandable to feel overwhelmed when dealing with multiple stressors. I'm here to help you navigate through this difficult time. Let's talk about some coping mechanisms and techniques that might help manage your anxiety levels.
