Person A: I'm so anxious about what's going to happen next. I can't stop worrying about the future.

Person B: Hey, calm down. Take a deep breath. Everything is going to be fine, you'll see.

Person A: But I can't help but think about all the possible outcomes. I feel overwhelmed with uncertainty.

Person B: It's natural to feel that way, but dwelling on it won't change anything. Sometimes, we just have to accept the feeling and let it pass.

Person A: But how can I accept it when it's making me feel so uneasy? I wish I could do something to stop the anxiety.

Person B: I understand how you're feeling, but right now, there's not much you can do. What you can do is trust that things will work out and focus on the present moment instead of worrying about the future.

Person A: I guess you're right. It's just hard not to get consumed by these thoughts.

Person B: I know it's hard, but try to focus on the things you can control right now. Take care of yourself, engage in activities that bring you joy, and surround yourself with positive influences. This will help you get through this anxious period.

Person A: Thank you for reminding me to stay grounded. I'll try my best to let go of my worries and trust that it will get better soon.

Person B: That's the spirit! Remember, this feeling won't last forever. Just take it one day at a time, and things will gradually fall into place. You're stronger than you think, and I believe in you.
