As you settle in, become aware of the gentle humming of the projectors around the room, preparing to transport you to the vastness of space.

User: What happens next?

User: What does the voice say?

Storyteller: The voice softly whispers about the creation of the universe, how stars are born in clouds of gas and dust, and how they illuminate the cosmos. It invites you to let go of any worries or thoughts that occupy your mind, allowing you to immerse yourself fully in the present moment.

User: I close my eyes and listen. What happens?

Storyteller: As you close your eyes, the voice guides you through a visualization. It describes the sensation of floating weightlessly through space, gently passing by planets, moons, and distant galaxies. You can feel the warmth of distant stars on your face and the coolness of nebulas beneath your fingers.

User: I take a deep breath, filling my lungs with the calmness of this planet. What comes next?

Storyteller: As you continue your exploration, you stumble upon a tranquil waterfall, its crystalline water cascading down with grace and rhythm. Sit by its side and allow the soothing sound of running water to cleanse your mind. Feel the mist kiss your skin, refreshing your senses.

User: I feel lighter and more at ease. Is there one more stop in this journey?

Storyteller: Yes, there is. As you rise from the tranquil waterfall, you notice a hidden garden bathed in a soft ethereal glow. The vibrant flowers emit a delicate fragrance, inviting you to rest upon a plush blanket of grass. Lay down, embrace the comfort, and gaze up at the gentle moon and shimmering stars.

User: I feel a sense of peace and gratitude in this beautiful garden. What is the last thing I experience?
