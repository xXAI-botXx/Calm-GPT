Person A: Hey, I really need to talk to someone. I'm having a major panic attack right now and I don't know what to do!

Person B: Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear that. Take deep breaths and try to calm down. Remember, you are not alone. I once went through something similar and found a way to distract myself from the panic. 

Person A: Okay, I'll try. What did you do to distract yourself?

Person B: Well, I remember one time when I was feeling really overwhelmed, I decided to go for a walk in nature. I was surrounded by trees and the sound of birds chirping. It was so peaceful and it helped me take my mind off things. 

Person A: That sounds nice. But I'm stuck at home right now.

Person B: No problem. Another time, I was faced with a stressful situation and I knew I couldn't change it, so I started writing in a journal about how I was feeling. It allowed me to release some of the pent-up emotions and provide a sense of relief.

Person A: That's actually a great idea. I've never tried journaling before, but maybe it'll help me too.

Person B: Give it a shot! Another thing I found helpful is doing some deep breathing exercises. Inhale slowly for a count of four, hold it for four, and then exhale for four. It really helps to relax your mind and body.

Person A: I'll definitely try that. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences and suggestions. I feel a little better already.

Person B: You're welcome. Remember, you're not alone. If you need someone to talk to or if you want to try any of these distractions together, I'm here for you.
