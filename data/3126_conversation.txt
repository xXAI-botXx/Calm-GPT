Storyteller: Wonderful. As you approach the mansion, notice the gentle rustling of leaves beneath your feet. It's as if the very ground is whispering its secrets. Now, as you step through the grand entrance, take a moment to imagine the atmosphere of the place. Is it gloomy or bathed in a warm, soft light?
