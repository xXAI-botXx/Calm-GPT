Patient: Good morning, Dr. Smith. Thank you for seeing me today.
Psychologist: Good morning, Mr. Johnson. It's my pleasure. How can I help you today?
Patient: I've been feeling very overwhelmed lately. I can't seem to shake this constant sense of anxiety.
Psychologist: I understand. Anxiety can be quite debilitating. Can you tell me more about what's been going on?
Patient: Well, I've been under a lot of pressure at work, and it's starting to take a toll on my mental health. I've been having difficulty sleeping and focusing on tasks.
Psychologist: It sounds like work is a major source of stress for you. Have you been able to communicate your concerns with your supervisor or seek any support?
Patient: I haven't really talked to anyone about it. I feel like I need to handle everything on my own, but it's becoming too much to bear.
Psychologist: It's important to remember that seeking support is not a sign of weakness. In fact, reaching out for assistance can often lead to finding healthier strategies to manage stress. Would you be open to exploring some coping mechanisms together?
Patient: Yes, I would be willing to try anything at this point. I just really want to feel more calm and in control of my life.
Psychologist: That's understandable. Let's start by addressing your current workload and finding ways to prioritize tasks more effectively. We can also work on relaxation techniques to help you release some of that anxiety. How does that sound?
Patient: That sounds like a good plan. I appreciate your willingness to help me through this difficult time.
