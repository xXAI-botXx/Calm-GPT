Person A: Hey 
Person B: Hey, how are you? 
Person A: Not so great, to be honest. 
Person B: I'm here to listen. What's been going on? 
Person A: I've been feeling really overwhelmed with everything going on at work. 
Person B: It sounds like work has been really stressful for you lately. Can you tell me more about what's been happening? 
Person A: My workload has been piling up and I feel like I can't keep up with the demands anymore. 
Person B: That sounds incredibly challenging. Have you spoken to your boss about how you're feeling? 
Person A: I haven't yet. I guess I'm afraid of how they'll react. 
Person B: It's understandable to feel apprehensive, but expressing your concerns could lead to finding a solution together. Would you like some advice on how to approach the conversation with your boss? 
Person A: Yes, that would be really helpful. 
Person B: First, try to schedule a one-on-one meeting with your boss. Be open and honest about how you've been feeling and provide specific examples of your workload and the impact it's having on you. Most importantly, focus on finding a solution together. Remember, your well-being matters. 
Person A: Thank you, that actually makes a lot of sense. I'll give it a shot and see how it goes. 
Person B: I believe in you! Remember, it's important to prioritize your own mental health and well-being. Let me know how the conversation with your boss goes, and if there's anything else I can do to support you.
