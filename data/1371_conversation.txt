Storyteller: Ah, the past. A beautiful topic for a story. Let's take a moment to center ourselves. Close your eyes and take a deep breath in through your nose, feeling the cool air fill your lungs. Now, slowly exhale through your mouth, releasing any tension or worries that may be weighing on your mind. Are you feeling more present?
