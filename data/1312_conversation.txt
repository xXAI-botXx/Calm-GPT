Person B: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me a little more about what's been going on? 
Person A: I've been dealing with a lot of stress at work and it's taking a toll on my mental health. 
Person B: That sounds really tough. How has it been affecting your daily life? 
Person A: I've been having trouble sleeping and I've lost my appetite. I just don't have the motivation to do anything anymore. 
Person B: It's understandable that you're feeling this way given the circumstances. Have you considered talking to someone about it, like a therapist or a counselor?

Person A: That would be great, thank you. I just want to find a way to feel better.
