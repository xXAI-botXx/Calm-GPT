Patient: Good morning, Dr. Smith. 
Psychologist: Good morning, John. How are you feeling today? 
Patient: I've been feeling really anxious lately. 
Psychologist: I'm here to listen. Can you tell me what has been causing your anxiety? 
Patient: It's mainly related to my job. I constantly worry about making mistakes and being judged by my colleagues. 
Psychologist: It sounds like you're putting a lot of pressure on yourself. Have you tried any coping mechanisms to deal with this anxiety? 
Patient: I've been practicing deep breathing exercises, but they only provide temporary relief. 
Psychologist: That's a great start. We can explore more techniques together. Additionally, have you considered talking to your colleagues or superiors about your concerns? 
Patient: I'm afraid that they will think I'm incapable or not up to the job. 
Psychologist: It's understandable to have those concerns, but keeping everything bottled up inside will only increase your anxiety. Sharing your worries might help alleviate some of the pressure you're feeling. 
Patient: I'll try to gather the courage to do that. 
Psychologist: Remember, you are capable and deserving of support. We can work on building your self-confidence and self-esteem throughout our sessions. 
Patient: Thank you, Dr. Smith. I appreciate your guidance. 
Psychologist: You're welcome, John. Remember, I'm here for you every step of the way.
