Person A: Hey, I don't know what to do! I lost my keys and I have to leave for work in 10 minutes!
Person B: Hey, take a deep breath. Don't panic. Have you checked all the usual places where you usually keep your keys?
Person A: Yes, I've looked everywhere. I can't find them!
Person B: Okay, I have an idea. Let's try distracting your mind for a moment. Can you quickly list three things you can see around you right now?
Person A: Umm, a lamp, my phone, and a book.
Person B: Great! Now, tell me two things you can hear at the moment.
Person A: I can hear the birds chirping outside and some soft music playing in the background.
Person B: Excellent! Finally, tell me one thing you can feel right now.
Person A: I can feel the warmth of the sunlight coming in through the window.
Person B: See? By focusing on these small things, you managed to take your mind off the stress for a moment. Now, let's go back to finding your keys. Check your pockets again, and also look under cushions or in between couch cushions. Sometimes they can get stuck there. Keep calm, you'll find them!
Person A: Okay, I'll give it another try. Thank you for helping me stay calm.
