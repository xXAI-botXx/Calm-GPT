Storyteller: Ah, the Stone Age, a time long, long ago when humans lived in harmony with nature. Close your eyes, take a deep breath, and imagine yourself stepping into a lush green forest. The air is crisp, and you can hear the gentle rustling of leaves as a soft breeze brushes against your skin. 

User: Okay, I'm there.

Storyteller: Perfect. As you continue walking through the forest, notice the vibrant colors of the flowers that surround you. Take a moment to breathe in deeply, allowing the calming scent of nature to fill your lungs. Feel the tension in your body slowly melt away with each breath you take.

Take a moment to cup your hands and drink from this pristine source of natural energy. Feel the water cleanse and invigorate you, washing away any worries or stress you may have.
