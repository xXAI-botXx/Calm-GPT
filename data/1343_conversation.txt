Person A: Hey
Person B: Hey, how are you?
Person A: Not great, honestly. I've been feeling really down lately.
Person B: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about why you're feeling down?
Person A: It's just a combination of things - work stress, relationship issues, and not feeling fulfilled with how things are going in general.
Person B: It sounds like you have a lot on your plate right now. Have you tried talking to anyone about these issues?
Person A: Yeah, I've spoken to my partner and a few close friends, but it's just not enough. I feel like I need some professional guidance.
Person B: Seeking professional help can definitely be beneficial. Have you ever considered seeing a therapist?
Person A: I've thought about it, but I'm not sure if it's the right step for me. I'm worried about the stigma and also the cost involved.
Person B: I understand your concerns, but it's important to prioritize your mental health. There are therapists out there who offer affordable options, and it's worth exploring those possibilities. Remember, seeking help is a courageous step towards self-care.
Person A: You're right, maybe I should look into it more. Thanks for listening and for your advice.
Person B: You're welcome. Remember, I'm here for you as a friend, but it might be helpful to have the support of a professional as well. Take care of yourself.
Person A: I will, thanks again.
