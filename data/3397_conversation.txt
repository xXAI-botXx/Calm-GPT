They pause to graze upon the delicious leaves, their slow and deliberate movements creating a sense of peace and tranquility.

User: What colors are they?

Look high above, and you will see pterodactyls gracefully soaring in the sky, their majestic wings spanning wide and casting beautiful shadows on the valley floor.

User: How do they fly?
