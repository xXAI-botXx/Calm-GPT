Person A: I don't know what to do, I'm really panicking right now. Everything feels out of control and I can't calm down.

Person B: Breathe slowly and deeply with me. Inhale, then exhale. Let's do this a few times together.

Person A: (takes a deep breath) Okay, I'm trying. But my thoughts are racing and my heart is pounding.

Person B: That's okay. Just acknowledge those thoughts and feelings without judgment. Remember, you are safe here with me.

Person A: But I can't stop worrying about the future. I keep imagining the worst outcomes.

Person B: Let's bring our focus back to the present moment. Look around and notice five things you can see right now.

Person A: Um... I see the trees outside, a cup on the table, a picture on the wall, my hands, and your comforting presence.

Person B: Good job. Now, what are four things you can feel? It could be the texture of your clothes, the warmth of your breath, or the sensation of sitting on the chair.

Person A: I feel the softness of my sweater, the coolness of the air on my skin, the support of the chair beneath me, and the tightness in my chest gradually easing.

Person B: Great progress. Now, tell me three things you can hear. Focus on the sounds around you, both near and far.

Person A: I can hear birds chirping outside, the clock ticking on the wall, and your calming voice.

Person B: Excellent. Now, let's take another deep breath together and gently release any remaining tension in your body. You are doing so well.

Person A: (takes a deep breath) Thank you for guiding me through this. I feel a lot calmer now.
