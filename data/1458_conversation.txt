Person A: Hey, are you there?
Person B: Hey, yes, what's up?
Person A: Well, I've been feeling really stressed and worried lately.
Person B: Oh no, what's been going on?
Person A: I've got so much work piling up and I'm afraid I won't be able to finish it all in time.
Person B: I totally get it, work can be overwhelming sometimes. But you know what always helps me when I'm stressed?
Person A: What?
Person B: There was this one time when I was running late for a meeting and I tripped over my own feet, right in front of my boss. It was so embarrassing, but we ended up laughing about it for the rest of the day. 
Person A: Haha, that's actually pretty funny. Thanks for sharing, it did make me smile.
Person B: You're welcome! Sometimes all we need is a little laughter to lighten the load. And hey, I'm here for you if you need any help with that work.
