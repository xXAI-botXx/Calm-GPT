Person A: Hey 
Person B: Hey, how are you? 
Person A: I'm feeling really anxious today. I've been thinking a lot about the future and it scares me. 
Person B: Oh, I understand. What specifically about the future scares you? 
Person A: I think it's the fear of the unknown. Not knowing what's going to happen or how my life will turn out. 
Person B: I see. The unknown can be intimidating, but it can also be exciting. Have you ever considered the possibilities that the future holds? 
Person A: I try to, but it's hard for me to look past the fear. 
Person B: It's completely normal to have fears, but remember that you are stronger than you think. You have faced the unknown before and navigated through it successfully. 
Person A: That's true, I have overcome challenges in the past. But this feels different, more uncertain. 
Person B: Change is often uncertain, but it's also an opportunity for growth. What are some positive things that could happen in the future? 
Person A: Well, I could find a job I love, meet new friends, and maybe even travel. 
Person B: Absolutely! Those are all wonderful possibilities. By embracing the unknown, you open yourself up to these incredible experiences. 
Person A: That's true, I shouldn't let fear hold me back from living life to the fullest. 
Person B: Exactly! Take small steps towards the unknown, and you'll realize that it's not as scary as it seems. You've got this! 
Person A: Thanks for listening and encouraging me. It means a lot. 
Person B: My pleasure! Anytime you're feeling overwhelmed, just remember that the unknown can bring amazing things into your life.
