Patient: Good morning, Dr. Smith. I hope you're doing well today.
Psychologist: Good morning, Mr. Johnson. Yes, I am. How about you?
Patient: I'm alright, thank you. I've been feeling a bit down lately and thought it would be good to come and talk to you.
Psychologist: I'm glad you reached out. It's important to address these feelings. Can you tell me a bit more about what's been going on?
Patient: Well, I've been feeling overwhelmed at work and it's been affecting my sleep. I also feel a lack of motivation and interest in things I used to enjoy.
Psychologist: I see. It sounds like you might be experiencing some symptoms of depression. Has anything significant happened recently that could have triggered these feelings?
Patient: Not really. I guess work has been more stressful lately, but nothing out of the ordinary. It just feels like everything is piling up.
Psychologist: It's not uncommon for work stress to have a significant impact on mental well-being. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or energy levels as well?
Patient: Yes, actually. My appetite has decreased and I often feel tired even after getting enough sleep.
Psychologist: These are important things to note. It's possible that your symptoms are related to a combination of stress and some internal factors. Let's work together to develop some strategies to help alleviate these symptoms.
