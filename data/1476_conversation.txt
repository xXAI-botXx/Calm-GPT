Person A: Hey, I've been feeling really anxious about my upcoming exams.
Person B: I understand, exams can be stressful. Have you tried any relaxation techniques?

Person A: No, I haven't. Can you suggest something simple?

Person B: Sure! One technique you can try is deep breathing. It's easy to do and can help calm your nerves. 

Person A: How do I do it?

Person B: Find a quiet and comfortable place to sit or lie down. Take a deep breath in through your nose for a count of four, hold it for a count of four, and then exhale slowly through your mouth for a count of four. Repeat this a few times and focus on your breath.

Person A: That sounds doable. I'll give it a try. 

Person B: Great! Remember to take your time and relax your body as you breathe. You can also try visualizing a peaceful place to help you relax even more.

Person A: Thanks for the advice. I'll let you know how it goes.

Person B: You're welcome! Good luck with your exams, and remember to take breaks and take care of yourself during this time.
