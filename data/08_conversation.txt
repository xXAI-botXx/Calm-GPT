Patient: I’ve been feeling so stressed and anxious lately. It’s like I can’t catch a break.

Therapist: I’m really sorry to hear that you’re feeling this way, but I’m glad you reached out. Remember, it’s okay to feel stressed and anxious. These are normal human emotions, especially in challenging times.

Patient: But it’s just too much. I feel like I’m drowning.

Therapist: It’s completely understandable to feel overwhelmed. But remember, just like the ocean’s tide, emotions come and go. It’s okay to let these feelings wash over you. You’re stronger than you think.

Patient: I just don’t know what to do.

Therapist: That’s perfectly okay. You don’t have to have all the answers right now. It’s important to take things one step at a time. Maybe we can start by identifying some coping strategies that have worked for you in the past?

Patient: I used to find exercise helpful, but I just don’t have the energy anymore.

Therapist: That’s a great start! Exercise is a wonderful stress reliever. Remember, it doesn’t have to be anything strenuous. Even a short walk can do wonders for your mood and energy levels. How about trying that?

Patient: Maybe I could try that…

Therapist: That sounds like a positive step forward. Remember, it’s okay to start small. Every journey begins with a single step. And I’m here to support you every step of the way.
