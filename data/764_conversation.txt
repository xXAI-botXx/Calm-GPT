Person A: Oh no, I can't believe this happened! I lost my wallet and I have no idea what to do!

Person B: Hey, calm down. Don't panic, we can figure this out. How about playing a game to distract your mind for a bit?

Person A: A game? But my wallet is missing, how can I think about anything else?

Person B: Trust me, it'll help. Let's play a simple word association game. I'll say a word, and you have to say the first word that comes to your mind. Ready?

Person A: Alright, let's give it a try.

Person B: Okay, the first word is "sunshine".

Person A: Beach.

Person B: Nice. Next word is "book".

Person A: Knowledge.

Person B: Great. Now, the word is "laughter".

Person A: Happiness.

Person B: Perfect. Last word, "adventure".

Person A: Travel.

Person B: See, you're doing great! That little distraction helped take your mind off the problem, didn't it?

Person A: Yes, it actually did. Thank you for trying to cheer me up, I really needed it.

Person B: No problem, we'll solve the wallet issue eventually. In the meantime, let's keep playing and keep our minds focused on something fun.
