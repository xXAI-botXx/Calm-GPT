Person A: Hey 
Person B: Hey, how are you? 
Person A: Not so good actually. I've been feeling really down lately. 
Person B: Oh no, what's been bothering you? 
Person A: I have this thing called Body Dysmorphic Disorder and it's really taking a toll on me. 
Person B: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me a little bit more about it? 
Person A: It's a mental disorder where I constantly obsess over perceived flaws in my appearance. It's really affecting my self-esteem. 
Person B: That must be really tough. How do you cope with it? 
Person A: I've tried therapy and medication, but sometimes it feels like nothing helps. 
Person B: I understand how frustrating that can be. But don't give up hope, there's always something that can make a difference. 
Person A: Thanks, I really appreciate your optimism. It's just hard when I can't even look in the mirror without feeling disgusted with myself. 
Person B: I can't even begin to understand what you go through, but I want you to know that you are so much more than what you see in the mirror. You have so many qualities that make you unique and special. 
Person A: That's really nice of you to say. It's just hard to believe sometimes. 
Person B: I know it might be hard to fully believe right now, but I truly believe it. Is there anything specific that triggers your negative thoughts? 
Person A: Anytime I see my reflection, really. I pick apart every little detail and it's exhausting. 
Person B: You're not alone in feeling that way. So many people struggle with body image, even if they don't have BDD. Have you tried any techniques to help distract yourself when these thoughts arise? 
Person A: Yeah, sometimes I'll try to focus on something else like reading or painting. It helps for a little while, but the thoughts always come back. 
Person B: Distracting yourself can be a great temporary solution. Maybe you can also try practicing self-compassion and replacing negative thoughts with positive affirmations. 
Person A: That sounds like a good idea. I'll give it a shot. 
Person B: Remember, you're not defined by your appearance. I believe in you and your ability to overcome this. 
Person A: Thank you, I really needed to hear that today.
