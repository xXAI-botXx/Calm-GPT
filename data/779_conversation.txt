Person A: Oh no, I can't find my keys anywhere! I have a meeting in 10 minutes and I'm starting to panic!
Person B: Hey, calm down! I have an idea to distract you from the stress. Let's play a quick word game!
Person A: I don't know if I'll be able to concentrate right now, but alright, let's give it a try.
Person B: Great! I'll give you a category, and you have to come up with as many words related to that category as possible in one minute. Ready?
Person A: Alright, I'll give it a shot. What's the category?
Person B: Animals. Go!
Person A: Dog, cat, elephant, lion, tiger, bear, monkey, giraffe, horse, rabbit, bird, snake, dolphin, turtle, kangaroo...
Person B: Great job! You managed to name 15 animals in just a minute. That's impressive!
Person A: Thanks, that was actually quite fun. It helped me take my mind off the keys for a little while.
Person B: See? Sometimes a small distraction can be a great way to reduce panic and anxiety. Now let's retrace your steps and find those keys together.
