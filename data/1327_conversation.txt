Person A: Hey
Person B: Hey, how are you feeling today?
Person A: I'm doing okay, but I've been feeling quite stressed lately.
Person B: I see. Can you pinpoint what's been causing the stress?
Person A: It's mainly work-related. There's just so much on my plate right now.
Person B: Have you been able to set any boundaries or find ways to manage the workload?
Person A: I've been trying, but it feels like I'm constantly playing catch-up.
Person B: It can be overwhelming when there's too much to handle. Have you considered talking to your manager about it?
Person A: Not yet, I'm afraid. I don't want to appear incapable.
Person B: It's important to remember that reaching out for support is a sign of strength, not weakness. Your manager might be able to help find a solution that works for both of you.
Person A: You're right. I should give it a try. Thanks for understanding.
Person B: Of course, that's what friends are for - to support each other. Remember, you don't have to face this alone.
Person A: I appreciate your support. It means a lot to me.
Person B: Anytime. Take care and let me know how it goes with your manager.
Person A: Will do. Thanks again.
