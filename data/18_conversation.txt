Person A: I’m just not feeling great today…

Person B: I’m sorry to hear that. Remember, it’s okay to have off days. We all do.

Person A: Yeah, I know. It’s just hard to shake off this feeling.

Person B: I understand. How about we try to distract you a bit? Do you remember that time we went hiking and you saw that squirrel? You were so excited!

Person A: Haha, yes! That squirrel was so chubby and cute.

Person B: Exactly! And remember how beautiful the sunset was from the top of the hill? Nature has a way of making us feel better.

Person A: You’re right. That was a good day.

Person B: And there will be many more good days to come. For now, let’s focus on the positive and remember that it’s okay to not be okay sometimes. You’re not alone.
