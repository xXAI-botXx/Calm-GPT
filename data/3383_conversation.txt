Storyteller: As you continue to explore, you notice a gentle vibration beneath your feet. It's the hum of the spaceship's engines, propelling you further into the unknown. Allow yourself to be guided by this soothing sensation, knowing that you are safe and protected.

User: I'm surrendering to the peacefulness of the vibrations.
