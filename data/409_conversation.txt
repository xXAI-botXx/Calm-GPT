Person A: I'm freaking out right now, I feel so panicked!
Person B: Take a deep breath. Now, tell me three random words.
Person A: Um, cat, rainbow, ocean.
Person B: Once upon a time, there was a cat who loved to chase rainbows. One day, while following a particularly bright rainbow, the cat accidentally fell into the ocean. But instead of sinking, the cat discovered that it could breathe underwater! It became the legendary underwater rainbow cat, swimming through the depths of the ocean, spreading joy and color wherever it went. So, remember, no matter how panicked you feel, there's always a rainbow cat swimming in an ocean of calmness!
Person A: (laughs) That's a funny story, thank you for calming me down!
