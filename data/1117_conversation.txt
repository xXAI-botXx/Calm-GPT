Person A: I'm freaking out!
Person B: Take a deep breath. Tell me three words that describe how you're feeling right now.

Person A: Overwhelmed, anxious, trapped.
Person B: Okay, let me tell you a little story. Once upon a time, there was a little fish swimming in a big pond. One day, it got caught in a net and started feeling overwhelmed. It didn't know what to do, and the more it struggled, the more anxious it became. But just when it thought all hope was lost, along came a wise seagull who saw its plight. The seagull swooped down, picked up the net with its sharp beak, and carried the little fish to safety. The fish realized that even when it felt trapped, there was always a way out. It just needed a little help from a friend.

Person A: That's actually a cute story. It's reminding me to ask for help when I'm overwhelmed.
Person B: Exactly! Sometimes, all it takes is a fresh perspective and a helping hand to navigate through difficult times. Remember, you're never alone in this pond of life.
