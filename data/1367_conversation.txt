Person A: Hey
Person B: Hey, how are you?
Person A: I'm really scared right now. I'm having a panic attack.
Person B: I understand that it feels overwhelming, but remember that it's just a passing feeling. Take a deep breath and try to focus on the present moment.
Person A: I can't stop trembling and my heart is racing.
Person B: It's normal to experience physical symptoms during a panic attack, but they won't harm you. You are safe. Let's do a breathing exercise together. Inhale deeply for 4 seconds, hold for 4 seconds, and exhale for 4 seconds. Repeat that a few times.
Person A: Okay, I'll try. *deep breaths*
Person B: Good job! Remember, you are in control of your thoughts. Try to replace the scary thoughts with positive affirmations. Say "I am safe, I am strong, and I can handle this."
Person A: I'm finding it hard to believe those affirmations right now.
Person B: That's okay, it takes time. Keep repeating them even if you don't fully believe them yet. Eventually, your mind will start accepting them. You've overcome challenges before, and you will do it again.
Person A: I guess you're right. I have overcome difficult situations in the past.
Person B: Exactly! And you have a support system here for you. Reach out to your loved ones when you need a reminder of how loved and capable you are. You're not alone in this.
Person A: Thank you for being there for me. It really means a lot.
Person B: You're welcome. Remember, you're resilient and you will get through this. Take it one step at a time. You've got this!
