Person A: Hey, I've been really struggling with exam anxiety lately. I get so nervous and it's affecting my ability to study and perform well. 
Person B: I'm sorry to hear that. Have you tried any relaxation techniques to help calm your nerves? 
Person A: No, not really. I'm not sure where to start. 
Person B: Well, one technique that might help is deep breathing. Would you like me to show you how to do it? 
Person A: Yes, please! I'm willing to try anything at this point. 
Person B: Great! Let's start by finding a comfortable seated position. Close your eyes and take a deep breath in through your nose, filling your lungs completely. 
Person A: (Deep breath) Okay, got it. 
Person B: Now, slowly exhale through your mouth, imagining you're releasing all the tension and stress from your body. 
Person A: (Exhales) That actually feels really good. 
Person B: Good! Let's continue. Take another deep breath in, counting to four as you do so. Hold your breath for a moment, and then exhale for a count of four. Try to make your exhales longer than your inhales. 
Person A: (Follows the instructions) I can already feel myself starting to relax a bit. 
Person B: That's the idea! Keep practicing this breathing technique whenever you start to feel overwhelmed or anxious. It can help bring your focus back to the present moment and calm your mind. 
Person A: Thank you so much for showing me this technique. I can't wait to incorporate it into my daily routine. 
Person B: You're welcome! Remember, it's normal to feel nervous before exams, but with practice and some relaxation techniques, you can overcome your test anxiety. Good luck! 
Person A: Thanks, I really appreciate your support. I'll definitely give it my best shot.
