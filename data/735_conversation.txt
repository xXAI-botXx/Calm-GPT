Inside, you're greeted by the comforting glow of the fireplace. The dancing flames cast a warm, golden light against the rustic bookshelves, adorned with well-loved novels and ancient artifacts.

Amongst them, you spot a small wooden chest adorned with elegant carvings. It beckons you to open it, revealing a collection of polished stones in various colors and sizes.
