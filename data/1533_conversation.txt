Take a deep breath in, letting the scent of the rich earth fill your lungs, and exhale slowly, releasing any tension you may be feeling.

Take a moment to breathe in again, inhaling the sweet fragrance of blooming flowers, allowing it to relax and ground you. As you walk further into the jungle, you come across a sparkling stream. Close your eyes, take a deep breath, and listen to the soothing sound of the water as it effortlessly glides over smooth rocks. Can you imagine the peacefulness it brings?

Visualize yourself floating alongside it, feeling the gentle breeze against your skin and the warmth of the sunlight on your face. Take a few moments to embrace this feeling of weightlessness and freedom as you exhale slowly.

Sit comfortably and take a deep breath in, feeling the calmness wash over you like a gentle wave. Now, as you exhale, release any lingering stress or worries, allowing them to fade away into the ether. Take a few moments to simply be, embracing the stillness that pervades this sacred space.
