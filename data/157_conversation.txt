Patient: Good morning, Doctor. 
Psychologist: Good morning. How are you feeling today? 
Patient: To be honest, I've been feeling really down lately. 
Psychologist: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me what you think might be causing these feelings? 
Patient: I've been dealing with a lot of stress at work, and it just seems like everything keeps piling up. I can't seem to find a balance anymore. 
Psychologist: It sounds like you're overwhelmed. Have you been able to identify any specific triggers or situations that worsen your mood? 
Patient: Well, I've noticed that whenever I have to give presentations or speak in front of a large group, my anxiety goes through the roof. It's been really affecting my performance and overall confidence. 
Psychologist: It's common to feel nervous in those situations. We can work on strategies together to help you manage your anxiety and improve your confidence when speaking in public. How does that sound? 
Patient: That would be great. I really want to overcome this fear and regain control of my professional life. 
Psychologist: Excellent. We can start by identifying any negative thoughts or beliefs you might have about public speaking, and then work on challenging and replacing them with more positive and realistic ones. 
Patient: That sounds like a good approach. I'm willing to put in the effort to make positive changes. 
Psychologist: That's a great mindset to have. Remember, progress takes time and patience, so be kind to yourself throughout this process. I'm here to support you every step of the way. 
Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your guidance and understanding. 
Psychologist: You're welcome. It's my job to help you. Let's set up a schedule for our sessions and start working towards your goals.
