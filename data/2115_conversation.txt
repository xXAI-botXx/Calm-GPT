Person A: I can see it. It's soothing and comforting.

Person B: Now, take a slow, deep breath in, feeling the coolness of the air entering your body. Hold it for a moment, and then exhale slowly, feeling the tension leave your body. Let go of any worries or stress.

Person A: *takes a deep breath in, holds it for a moment, and slowly exhales* That feels nice. I feel a sense of calm washing over me.

Person A: I can see it. It's like a gentle cosmic ballet. It's mesmerizing.
