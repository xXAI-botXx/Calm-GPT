Person A: I can't believe what just happened! I am so angry!
Person B: I hear you. It sounds like something really upset you. Would you like to talk about it?
Person A: I just had a huge argument with my best friend. They betrayed my trust and I feel so hurt and angry.
Person B: I'm sorry to hear that happened. It can be really difficult when someone we care about lets us down. 
Person A: I invested so much in that friendship, and now it feels like it was all for nothing. I don't know if I can ever trust them again.
Person B: It's natural to feel betrayed and to question the trust in your relationship. It's important to remember that healing will take time, and it's okay to take that time to process your emotions.
Person A: But what if I can't forgive them? What if I can never trust them again?
Person B: It's okay to not have all the answers right now. Forgiveness is a personal journey, and it's something that comes in time, if it comes at all. You have every right to protect yourself and set boundaries if you feel that's what's best for you.
Person A: Thank you for understanding and not pushing me to forgive or forget. It means a lot to me.
Person B: Of course. I want you to know that your feelings are valid, and I'm here to support you through this process.
