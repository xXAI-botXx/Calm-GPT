Person A: I'm freaking out! I feel so overwhelmed and scared!

Person B: Take a deep breath. I'm here for you. Let's try something different. Give me three random words, any three words, and I'll tell you a funny and imaginative story to take your mind off things.

Person A: Okay, um... banana, spaceship, and dancing.

Person B: Once upon a time, in a universe far away, there was a brave astronaut named Barry. He was on a mission to explore new planets. One day, while floating in his spaceship, he discovered a mysterious planet made entirely of bananas. Yes, you heard that right, bananas!

Person A: (laughs) That's unexpected!

Person B: Now, as Barry landed on the banana planet, he noticed something peculiar. The bananas would start dancing whenever he got near them. It was a sight to behold! Banana ballet, if you will.

Person A: (laughs even harder) Oh wow, that's hilarious!

Person B: Absolutely! But here comes the twist. The bananas started growing bigger and bigger with every dance move. It wasn't long before they became giant banana warriors, towering over poor Barry and his spaceship!

Person A: (laughs uncontrollably) This is amazing!

Person B: With quick thinking, Barry grabbed his trusty banana peel sword, which conveniently he brought with him, and started performing his own dance moves. He called it the "Cosmic Shuffle." As he danced, the giant bananas began to shrink back to normal size, their warrior demeanor replaced with joy and laughter.

Person A: (calming down) Thank you so much for that story. It really helped distract me and made me feel better.

Person B: I'm glad to hear that. Remember, sometimes a bit of silliness and imagination can make the world seem less scary. And hey, whenever life gets overwhelming, just picture yourself doing the Cosmic Shuffle!

Person A: (smiling) I definitely will. Thanks again, you're an amazing therapist!

Person B: You're most welcome. Take care and remember that I'm always here to lend an ear and share a wacky story whenever you need it!
