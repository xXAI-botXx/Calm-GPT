Patient: Hey 
Therapist: Hello, how are you feeling today? 
Patient: Stressed out and overwhelmed. 
Therapist: I understand, it's normal to feel that way sometimes. What's been causing your stress? 
Patient: Work deadlines and personal issues. 
Therapist: It sounds like you have a lot on your plate. Remember to take things one step at a time and prioritize self-care. 
Patient: Easier said than done. 
Therapist: I know it can be challenging, but small changes can make a big difference. What's one small thing you can do today to take care of yourself? 
Patient: Maybe I can go for a walk during my lunch break. 
Therapist: That's a great idea! Fresh air and movement can help clear your mind. How about setting a reminder on your phone to make sure you don't forget? 
Patient: I can do that. 
Therapist: Fantastic! And remember, progress is progress, no matter how small. How else can you make your day a little less overwhelming? 
Patient: Maybe I can delegate some tasks or ask for help. 
Therapist: Absolutely! Don't be afraid to reach out to others. You don't have to face everything alone. Is there someone you trust who can assist you? 
Patient: My coworker has offered to help before. I'll talk to her. 
Therapist: That's wonderful! It's great to have supportive colleagues. Remember, you don't have to carry the weight of the world on your shoulders. Is there anything else you'd like to talk about? 
Patient: No, I think this is a good starting point. Thank you for your support. 
Therapist: You're very welcome. Remember, I'm here for you whenever you need to talk. Take care of yourself and have a great day!
