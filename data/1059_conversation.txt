Notice how the blue oceans contrast with the lush green landmasses. Allow yourself to feel a sense of awe and appreciation for the splendor of our home.

Storyteller: Now, let's explore one of the station's compartments. As you enter, notice the smooth, metallic walls and the gentle artificial gravity keeping you grounded. In this room, there is an observatory where you can observe distant galaxies and celestial bodies. Find a comfortable spot and take a seat, focusing your attention on the enormous telescope.
