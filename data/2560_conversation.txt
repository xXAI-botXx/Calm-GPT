Storyteller: Now, pay attention to the cloud beneath you. Visualize lying on it, feeling its softness supporting your body. This fluffy pillow cloud carries you effortlessly across the sky. As you glide along, you notice the world below becoming smaller and smaller. Can you imagine looking down on the vastness of the earth?

User: Yes, I can see the tiny houses and the winding rivers.

Storyteller: Take a moment to appreciate the intricacies of nature. From up here, every tree, every mountain, and every body of water seems interconnected, like a beautifully woven tapestry. Now, slowly descend back to the meadow, feeling the cloud gently lowering you down. As your feet touch the ground, take one final deep breath in, and slowly open your eyes.

User: Wow, that was a calming and beautiful experience. Thank you.
