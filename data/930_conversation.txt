Person A: Oh my god, I can't believe this is happening! I lost my wallet with all my money and identification cards!

Person B: Take a deep breath, everything will be okay. Let's try not to panic. How about we play a fun game to distract you from the stress?

Person A: I don't know if that will help, but I guess it's worth a shot.

Person B: Great! How about we play "Would You Rather"? I'll ask you a series of questions, and you have to choose between two options, no matter how absurd they may be. It's a great way to take your mind off things.

Person A: Alright, let's give it a try. Anything to take my mind off this situation.

Person B: Alright, here's the first question: Would you rather be able to fly or be invisible?

Person A: Hmm... That's a tough one. I think I would choose to fly because it would be amazing to soar through the sky and explore new places from above.

Person B: Good choice! Now, next question: Would you rather never be able to use the internet again or never be able to watch TV again?

Person A: That's a tricky one. But I guess I would choose to never be able to watch TV again because the internet has so much more to offer in terms of communication, learning, and entertainment.

Person B: Interesting choice! Okay, last question: Would you rather live in a world without music or a world without books?

Person A: That's a difficult one. As much as I love music, I think I would choose to live in a world without music because books have always been my escape and source of knowledge.

Person B: That was really fun, wasn't it? See, even for a brief moment, your mind was occupied with something other than your worries.

Person A: You're right. Playing this game did help me momentarily forget about my lost wallet. Thank you for distracting me and reminding me that there are other things in life to focus on.

Person B: Of course! Remember, everything will work out. We can deal with the wallet situation later, but for now, let's enjoy the present moment and try to stay positive.

Person A: Thank you for being there for me and for suggesting this game. It really did help me relax and take my mind off things.

Person B: I'm glad I could help. Remember, I'm here for you, and we will find a solution together.
