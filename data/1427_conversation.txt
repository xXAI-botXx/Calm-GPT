Person A: Hey, I've been feeling really anxious lately. 
Person B: I'm sorry to hear that. What's been causing your anxiety? 
Person A: I'm just worried about so many things; my job, my relationship, my health... 
Person B: I understand, it can be overwhelming. Have you tried any strategies to calm yourself down? 
Person A: I've tried some deep breathing exercises, but they don't seem to help much. 
Person B: Hmm, have you heard of the 4-7-8 breathing technique? It's really simple and can be quite effective. 
Person A: No, I haven't. How does it work? 
Person B: It's basically inhaling for 4 seconds, holding your breath for 7 seconds, and then exhaling for 8 seconds. 
Person A: That sounds easy enough. I'll give it a try. 
Person B: Great! Remember to find a comfortable position and focus on your breath while doing it. 
Person A: Okay, I'll make sure to do that. Thanks for suggesting the technique. 
Person B: You're welcome! Let me know if it helps you feel more relaxed. 
Person A: Will do. Thanks for being so supportive.
