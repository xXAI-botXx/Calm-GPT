Person A: I'm feeling really anxious right now. I can't seem to calm my mind down.

Person B: Take a deep breath, my friend. I'm here to help. Have you tried any relaxation techniques before?

Person A: I've tried counting to ten, but it didn't seem to work. Do you have any other suggestions?

Person B: Yes, there's a simple but effective technique called square breathing. Let's give it a try. Take a slow, deep breath in while counting to four.

Person A: Okay, I'll give it a shot. *Inhales deeply* One... two... three... four...

Person B: Now, hold your breath for a count of four.

Person A: *Holds breath* One... two... three... four...

Person B: Great! Now, exhale slowly for a count of four.

Person A: *Exhales* One... two... three... four...

Person B: Good job. Finally, hold your breath again for a count of four.

Person A: *Holds breath* One... two... three... four...

Person B: You're doing fantastic. Just repeat this pattern a few more times, focusing on your breath and counting in your mind. Allow the tension to melt away with every breath.

Person A: Thank you so much for guiding me through this. I can already feel a sense of calm washing over me.

Person B: You're welcome. Remember, you have the power to control your thoughts and find peace within you. Whenever you feel anxious, you can always come back to this square breathing technique.

Person A: I will definitely keep that in mind. It's amazing how something as simple as breathing can help calm me down.
