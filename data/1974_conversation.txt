As you venture deeper into the woods, you notice a path emerging before you. The path is lined with colorful wildflowers, their soft petals swaying gently in the breeze. Step by step, you find yourself drawn closer to the enchanting cottage.

The roof is made of intricately woven thatch, protecting the cottage from raindrops that sprinkle down like blessings. As you approach the entrance, you notice a beautiful wooden door adorned with intricate carvings, revealing the creativity and wisdom that lies within.

Storyteller: You gently push open the door, and enter a cozy space filled with warm, golden light. The interior of the cottage is adorned with tapestries that depict tranquil scenes of nature – waterfalls cascading down mountains, vibrant sunsets painting the sky, and wildlife peacefully coexisting. The sound of a crackling fireplace fills the room, inviting you to come closer and bathe in its comforting warmth.

User: Is there anyone inside the cottage?
Storyteller: As you explore the cottage, you come across a small room filled with shelves upon shelves of ancient books and scrolls. A wise witch, with gentle eyes and a kind smile, sits at a wooden desk, surrounded by dried herbs and bottles of magical ingredients. She invites you to sit beside her and share your thoughts and worries, offering you a warm cup of herbal tea known for its soothing properties.

Her calming voice envelops you, like a soft embrace, as she encourages you to let go of any negativity, allowing it to dissipate into the ether.
