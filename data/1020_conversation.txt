Patient: Good afternoon, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me today.
Psychologist: Good afternoon. It's my pleasure. How can I assist you?
Patient: I've been feeling really overwhelmed lately. I constantly feel anxious and have trouble sleeping. 
Psychologist: I'm sorry to hear that. When did you first start noticing these symptoms?
Patient: It's been going on for a few months now. It started after a major life event - a job loss and the end of a long-term relationship.
Psychologist: Those are significant stressors indeed. How do you cope with these feelings of anxiety?
Patient: I've been trying different relaxation techniques like deep breathing and meditation, but they only provide temporary relief.
Psychologist: I see. It sounds like you've been proactive in finding ways to cope. Have you noticed any patterns or triggers for your anxiety?
Patient: Yes, I've noticed that crowded places and social situations tend to trigger my anxiety the most. It's becoming harder for me to be around people.
Psychologist: It's important to identify triggers to better understand your anxiety. Have you considered seeking support from friends or family members?
Patient: I haven't really opened up to them yet. I'm afraid they might not understand or judge me for my feelings.
Psychologist: It's common to feel apprehensive about sharing our struggles, but you might be surprised by the support you receive. Building a strong support system can greatly benefit your mental health. Is there anything else you'd like to share with me today?
Patient: Well, sometimes I also experience panic attacks. My heart races, and I feel like I can't breathe. It's really frightening.
Psychologist: Panic attacks can be very distressing. It's important to know that you're not alone in experiencing them. We can work together to identify triggers and develop coping strategies to manage the panic attacks. How about we schedule regular sessions to address these concerns? 
Patient: That sounds like a good plan. I appreciate your help, Doctor.
Psychologist: My goal is to support you on your journey towards better mental health. I'm here to listen and assist you every step of the way. See you at our next session.
