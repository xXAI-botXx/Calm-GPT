Storyteller: Welcome to the safari, my friend. Take a deep breath and close your eyes. Imagine yourself surrounded by the gentle rustling of tall grasses and the soft, warm breeze brushing against your skin. Feel the golden glow of the sun enveloping you, as we embark on this tranquil journey together.

Storyteller: You are now standing at the edge of a vast wilderness, stretching as far as the eye can see. As you open your eyes, you notice a magnificent herd of elephants meandering gracefully in the distance. Their powerful yet peaceful presence fills the air with a sense of serenity. Take a moment to admire their majestic beauty.

Storyteller: Now, let's continue our peaceful walk through the savannah, through the soft hues of the setting sun. As you take each step, feel the connection between your body and the earth beneath you. With each footfall, imagine releasing any tension or worries, allowing them to fade away into the ground.

Storyteller: As the day turns to dusk, the sky transforms into a breathtaking tapestry of colors. Radiant oranges melt into gentle pinks and purples, creating a calming atmosphere. Picture yourself lying on the soft grass, gazing up at the canvas above, and slowly begin to match your breath with the rhythm of the sky.

Person A: *Lies down, inhaling and exhaling in sync with the colors of the sky*

Storyteller: In this tranquil moment, allow your mind to wander to the distant roar of a lion. Picture the king of the jungle in all its glory, radiating strength, yet exhibiting a calm confidence. As you hear its powerful call, let it remind you of the strength within you, knowing that you are capable of facing any challenge that comes your way.

Person A: *Smiles, feeling a sense of calm and gratitude*
