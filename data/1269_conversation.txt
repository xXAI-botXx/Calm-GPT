Person A: Hey 
Person B: Hey, how are you? 
Person A: Not so great, feeling really overwhelmed with work lately. 
Person B: I'm here for you. Would you like to talk about what's been going on? 
Person A: Honestly, I don't even know where to start. It feels like everything is piling up. 
Person B: Take a deep breath. Let's break it down. What specifically is causing you the most stress right now? 
Person A: Well, I have a huge deadline coming up and I feel like I'll never get everything done in time. 
Person B: It's understandable that you're feeling pressured. Have you considered breaking down the tasks into smaller, manageable steps? 
Person A: I haven't really thought about that. I guess it could help. 
Person B: Breaking things down can make them feel less overwhelming. Maybe you can create a to-do list and prioritize your tasks? 
Person A: That sounds like a good idea. I'll give it a try. 
Person B: Good. Remember, it's important to take breaks and look after yourself as well. How else can I support you? 
Person A: It would help if I could just vent sometimes. Is it okay if I reach out to you when things get tough? 
Person B: Of course, anytime. I'm here to listen and support you. Don't hesitate to reach out whenever you need to. 
Person A: Thank you so much, it means a lot to me. 
Person B: You're welcome. Remember, you're not alone in this. We'll get through it together.
