Person A: Hey
Person B: Hey, how are you feeling today?
Person A: Not too great, to be honest. I've been feeling really stressed lately.
Person B: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about what's been going on?
Person A: I've been overwhelmed with work and I feel like I can't keep up anymore. It's causing me a lot of anxiety.
Person B: It sounds like the workload is really taking a toll on you. Have you tried talking to your boss about this?
Person A: No, I haven't. I don't want to seem incapable or unreliable.
Person B: I understand your hesitation, but remember that it's important to advocate for your mental health. Your boss might be willing to help alleviate some of the pressure if they know how it's affecting you.
Person A: You're right, I should give it a try. I just don't want to be seen as weak.
Person B: Seeking support is not a sign of weakness, but rather strength. It takes courage to admit when you're struggling and to ask for help. You deserve to have a healthy work-life balance.
Person A: Thank you for reminding me of that. I guess I just needed someone to talk to who understands.
Person B: I'm always here to listen and support you. Remember, it's important to prioritize your well-being and take steps to reduce stress in your life.
Person A: I really appreciate your support. It means a lot to me.
