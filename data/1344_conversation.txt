Person A: Super powers.

Person B: Ah, super powers. That's a fascinating topic. What comes to your mind when you think about super powers?

Person A: I imagine flying through the sky, having super strength, and being able to do incredible things.

Person B: Those are wonderful super powers to envision. Close your eyes for a moment and take a deep breath in, feeling the cool air fill your lungs. And as you exhale, release any tension or worries you may be feeling. Now, let me take you on a calm and soothing journey with our imagination.

Person A: Alright, I'm ready.

Person B: Imagine yourself in a peaceful meadow, surrounded by vibrant flowers and tall, swaying grass. The sun is gently warming your skin, and a gentle breeze brushes against your face. Can you feel this serene setting?

Person A: Yes, it's beautiful.

Person B: As we explore this calm meadow, you notice a small, sparkling pond in the distance. Its water is clear and inviting. Walk towards it, step by step, feeling the soft ground beneath your feet. Take a deep breath in, allowing the sweet scents of nature to fill your lungs.

Person A: *Inhales deeply* I can smell the blooming flowers.

Person B: Wonderful. Arriving at the pond, you notice something shimmering beneath the surface. It's a radiant, glowing crystal. Slowly dip your fingers into the water and retrieve it. As you hold the crystal in your hand, you feel a surge of energy flowing through you. This crystal has granted you a special power. What do you think it could be?

Person A: I think it's the power to calm and heal others.

Person B: That's a beautiful choice. With this power, you can bring peace and positivity to those around you. As you continue your journey with this newfound ability, you encounter people who are feeling anxious or overwhelmed. Take a moment to connect with their energy and breathe in deeply, envisioning your calming power expanding within you.

Person A: *Inhales deeply* I can feel the energy flowing through me.

Person B: Good. Now, gently place your hand on their shoulders or hold their hands. As they look into your eyes, they feel a sense of tranquility washing over them. Their worries slowly dissipate, replaced by a deep sense of calmness. Take a breath in, releasing any remaining tension within them, and exhale together, letting go of any negative thoughts.

Person A: *Breathes in and out* I can feel their energy shifting.

Person B: Well done. Remember, as you encounter more people, share your calming power with them. Use this super power to spread positivity and serenity wherever you go. And as you do so, always remember to take moments for yourself, to breathe deeply and reconnect with your own inner peace.

Person A: Thank you for this calming and empowering journey.

Person B: You're most welcome. Remember, your super power exists within you, waiting to be used for the benefit of others. Embrace it and always know that peace and tranquility are within your reach.
