Patient: Good morning, Dr. Smith.
Psychologist: Good morning, John. How are you feeling today?
Patient: I've been feeling really low lately. I can't seem to shake off this sadness.
Psychologist: I see. Can you tell me more about what's been going on?
Patient: Well, I recently lost my job, and that has left me feeling defeated and hopeless. I've been struggling to find motivation to do anything.
Psychologist: Losing a job can be a significant stressor. How is it affecting your daily life?
Patient: I find it difficult to get out of bed in the morning. I have no energy or interest in doing things I used to enjoy. I've also started experiencing trouble sleeping.
Psychologist: It's understandable that you're feeling this way given the circumstances. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite?
Patient: Yes, my appetite has decreased significantly. I've lost a few pounds over the past couple of weeks.
Psychologist: I'm sorry to hear that you're going through such a tough time. It's important to remember that you don't have to face this alone. Have you considered reaching out to friends or family for support?
Patient: I've been hesitant to burden them with my problems. I don't want to feel like a burden to anyone.
Psychologist: It's important to remember that seeking support is not a sign of weakness. Talking to someone you trust can provide comfort and a fresh perspective. Additionally, I'm here to support you as well.
Patient: Thank you, Dr. Smith. I appreciate your understanding. I'll try to open up to my loved ones and seek their support.
