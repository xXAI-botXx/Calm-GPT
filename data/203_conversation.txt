Patient: Good morning, Dr. Smith. I'm feeling really anxious lately.
Psychologist: Good morning, John. I'm here to listen. Can you tell me more about what's been bothering you?
Patient: I've been having trouble sleeping and I feel constantly on edge. My heart rate seems to always be elevated.
Psychologist: It sounds like you're experiencing symptoms of anxiety. Can you think of any specific triggers for these feelings?
Patient: Well, I recently started a new job and it's been quite challenging. I'm constantly worried about making mistakes and not meeting expectations.
Psychologist: Starting a new job can definitely be stressful, and it's common to feel this way. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or interests?
Patient: I've become more irritable and feel less motivated to do activities I used to enjoy. I just can't seem to focus on anything.
Psychologist: These changes in behavior are important to note. It could be a sign of stress taking a toll on your overall well-being. Have you talked to anyone about these feelings?
Patient: Not really, I've been trying to deal with them on my own. But I'm realizing it's becoming overwhelming and affecting my daily life.
Psychologist: It's brave of you to recognize that you need support. I'm glad you reached out. Let's work together to develop coping strategies and techniques to manage your anxiety. We can also explore different treatment options such as therapy or medication if necessary.
Patient: That sounds like a plan. I really need some guidance on how to better handle these feelings.
