Person A: Hey. 
Person B: Hi there! How are you today? 
Person A: I'm feeling a bit anxious. I have this fear of the unknown. 
Person B: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about it? 
Person A: It's just this overwhelming feeling of uncertainty and not knowing what's going to happen. It makes me anxious all the time. 
Person B: I understand. Uncertainty can be tough, but it can also bring so many exciting possibilities. What specifically makes you anxious about the unknown? 
Person A: I guess not knowing how things will turn out. It makes me worry about making the wrong decisions or facing unexpected challenges. 
Person B: I can see why that would weigh on you. But remember, every decision you make is an opportunity for growth and learning. Sometimes the unknown can lead to wonderful surprises. 
Person A: Yeah, I suppose you're right. It's just hard to shake off the worry sometimes. 
Person B: That's completely normal. It's human nature to worry. But try to focus on the present moment and what you can control right now. Let go of what's beyond your control. 
Person A: I'll try my best. Do you have any suggestions on how to deal with this fear? 
Person B: Absolutely! One helpful tip is practicing mindfulness. It can help you stay grounded in the present and reduce anxiety about the future. Would you like me to guide you through a quick mindfulness exercise? 
Person A: That would be great, thank you. 
Person B: Alright, let's start by taking a deep breath in, and slowly exhaling. As you breathe, bring your attention to the sensations in your body. Notice any tension and consciously let it go, allowing your body to relax. Let go of any thoughts about the unknown, and just focus on your breath in this present moment.
