Person A: I can't breathe, I feel like I'm having a panic attack. I don't know what to do!

Person B: Take deep breaths, just focus on inhaling and exhaling slowly. You're going to be okay, I'm here with you.

Person A: But I feel like I'm losing control, my heart is racing and I'm shaking.

Person B: It's okay, panic attacks can be really overwhelming, but they can't harm you. Let's try a grounding exercise together. Look around and name five things you can see.

Person A: Okay... I see a lamp, a bookshelf, a plant, my phone, and a picture frame.

Person B: Good, now touch four things around you and describe how they feel.

Person A: I'm touching the table which feels smooth, the cushion which is soft, the keys on my keyboard which feel cold, and my own skin which feels warm.

Person B: Great job! Now listen for three sounds, and describe what you hear.

Person A: I can hear birds chirping outside, the hum of the refrigerator, and the sound of my own breathing.

Person B: Excellent! Now take a deep breath and let it out slowly. Keep focusing on your breathing and the sensations around you. Remember, you're safe and these sensations will pass.

Person A: Thank you for helping me calm down. I feel much better now.

Person B: I'm glad I could help. If you ever feel overwhelmed again, remember to focus on your breathing and use these grounding exercises. I'm here for you, always.
