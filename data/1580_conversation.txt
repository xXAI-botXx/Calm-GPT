Person A: Hey, I'm feeling really anxious right now.
Person B: Hey, it's okay. Take a deep breath. Everything will be fine.
Person A: I can't stop worrying about the future.
Person B: It's natural to feel that way sometimes. Try to focus on the present moment instead.
Person A: But what if things don't work out?
Person B: Don't worry about that right now. Just accept the feeling and know that it's temporary. Things have a way of working themselves out.
Person A: I wish I could do something to change it.
Person B: Sometimes, accepting the feeling is the best thing you can do. You can't control everything. Just trust that things will get better soon.
Person A: I'll try my best to focus on the present then.
Person B: That's the spirit. Remember, this feeling won't last forever. You'll get through it.
