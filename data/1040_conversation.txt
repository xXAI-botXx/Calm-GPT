Person A: I can't believe how unfair this is! I worked so hard for that promotion, and they gave it to someone else!

Person B: I hear your frustration. It's completely understandable that you feel angry and disappointed. Can you tell me more about what happened?

Person A: I exceeded all my targets and even received excellent feedback from my clients. I don't understand why they didn't choose me.

Person B: It sounds like you put in a lot of effort and felt deserving of that promotion. It must be really tough to not see your hard work recognized. 

Person A: It's just so frustrating! I thought they valued my contributions to the company.

Person B: It's understandable that you might be questioning your value and worth right now. Remember, their decision doesn't define your abilities or worth as a person. You have many talents and skills that are valuable no matter what.

Person A: I know, but it's hard not to take it personally. I feel like a failure.

Person B: It's completely normal to feel that way, but I want you to know that one setback doesn't define your entire career or who you are as a person. It's important to recognize your achievements thus far and keep pushing forward.

Person A: I guess you're right. I shouldn't let this one disappointment overshadow everything else I've accomplished.

Person B: That's the spirit! Remember, setbacks are part of life, but it's how we respond and learn from them that truly matters. Don't hesitate to reach out if you need any support or guidance moving forward.

Person A: Thank you for being so understanding and supportive. It really means a lot to me.
