Storyteller: Ah, the majestic waterfall. Close your eyes and imagine yourself standing at the edge of a lush green forest, where the sound of birds singing fills the air. You can feel a gentle breeze caressing your skin as you approach the waterfall. Take a deep breath in through your nose, and exhale slowly through your mouth. Allow your body to relax as we embark on this peaceful journey.
