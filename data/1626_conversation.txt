Person A: Hey, can we talk for a moment?
Person B: Sure, what's up?
Person A: I've been feeling really anxious lately, and I don't know how to deal with it.
Person B: I understand. Anxiety can be tough. Have you tried any coping mechanisms?
Person A: Yeah, but sometimes it gets overwhelming. I feel like everyone is judging me.
Person B: I know it may seem that way, but the truth is, most people are too busy worrying about themselves to pay much attention to others.
Person A: Really? You think so?
Person B: Absolutely. Everyone has their own stuff going on, and it's rare for people to focus on someone else's insecurities.
Person A: That actually makes me feel a bit better. I guess I shouldn't worry so much about what others think.
Person B: That's a healthy mindset! Remember, you are important and deserve to prioritize your own well-being.
Person A: Thanks, I needed to hear that. I'll try my best to keep it in mind.
Person B: You're welcome. Just take it one step at a time, and remember that you're not alone in dealing with anxiety.
