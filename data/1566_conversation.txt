Person A: Hey 
Person B: Hey, how are you? 
Person A: Not so great, actually. I've recently been diagnosed with Acute Stress Disorder. 
Person B: Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. What exactly does that mean? 
Person A: It's a psychological condition that occurs after experiencing a traumatic event. I've been having flashbacks, nightmares, and feeling constantly on edge. 
Person B: That sounds really tough. Have you spoken to a therapist about it? 
Person A: Yes, I have. They say I'll need some therapy sessions to help me work through it. 
Person B: That's a good step. Therapy can be really helpful. Is there anything I can do to support you? 
Person A: Just talking about it with someone who understands helps a lot, so thank you. 
Person B: Of course, anytime. Remember, you're not alone in this. Have you tried any relaxation techniques to help manage your symptoms? 
Person A: I've been trying deep breathing exercises and meditation, but it's still hard to calm down sometimes. 
Person B: It can take time, but don't get discouraged. Keep practicing and try to find what works best for you. Have you considered any additional coping strategies like journaling or exercise? 
Person A: I haven't thought about journaling, but exercise has been helpful in releasing some tension. 
Person B: That's great to hear. Physical activity can be a great way to release stress and boost your mood. Is there anything else you want to talk about or any other questions you have? 
Person A: I think I'm good for now, but I really appreciate your support and encouragement. It means a lot to me. 
Person B: You're welcome. Remember, I'm always here if you need someone to talk to. Take care and be gentle with yourself as you navigate through this.
