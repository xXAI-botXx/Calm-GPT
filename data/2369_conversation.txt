Storyteller: As you continue on your journey, you notice a beautiful waterfall up ahead. The sound of cascading water fills the air, creating a soothing melody that resonates within your soul.

User: I'm drawn towards the waterfall. What lies beyond it?
Storyteller: The boat carries you effortlessly through the waterfall, and as you emerge on the other side, you find yourself in a hidden oasis. The air is filled with the sweet fragrance of blooming flowers and the singing of birds.
