Patient: Good afternoon, Dr. Adams. Thank you for seeing me today.

Psychologist: Good afternoon, Mr. Johnson. It's my pleasure. How can I assist you?

Patient: Well, I've been feeling really anxious lately. I can't seem to shake this constant feeling of uneasiness.

Psychologist: I see. When did these feelings of anxiety start?

Patient: I think it began about a month ago, when I started a new job. I've been having trouble sleeping, and I constantly worry about making mistakes at work.

Psychologist: It sounds like your new job has created a lot of stress for you. Can you tell me more about what specific worries you've been having?

Patient: Sure. I constantly worry about not meeting the expectations of my colleagues and superiors. I'm afraid they'll find out that I'm not as competent as they think I am.

Psychologist: It's common to feel this way when experiencing a new challenge. Have you noticed any changes in your daily habits or routines since this started?

Patient: Yes, I have. I've been avoiding social situations and isolating myself more. I've also lost my appetite and have trouble focusing on simple tasks.

Psychologist: These changes in behavior and appetite are important indicators of the impact anxiety can have on our daily lives. Have you tried any strategies to manage your anxiety so far?

Patient: I've tried deep breathing exercises and counting to ten when I feel overwhelmed. While they help temporarily, the anxiety always creeps back in.

Psychologist: It sounds like you've been actively trying to manage your anxiety, which is commendable. I suggest we work together to develop a more comprehensive approach. We can explore techniques such as cognitive behavioral therapy to help challenge negative thoughts and build resilience.

Patient: That sounds like a good plan. I really want to regain control of my life and feel more at ease again.

Psychologist: Great! I'm here to support you throughout this journey. Let's schedule our next appointment for next week so we can start implementing these strategies and assess your progress.

Patient: Thank you, Dr. Adams. I appreciate your guidance and support. I'm looking forward to our next session.

Psychologist: You're very welcome, Mr. Johnson. Remember, we're in this together. Take care until our next meeting.
