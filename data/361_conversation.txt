User: Do I hear anything?
Storyteller: Listen closely... the garden is alive with a symphony of sounds. The tranquil trickling of a small waterfall nearby, creating a soothing melody. Birds sing their songs from the branches above, their melodies carrying with the wind. The gentle rustling of leaves as they dance in harmony with nature's rhythm.

User: Can I touch anything?
Storyteller: As you stroll deeper into the garden, you come across a small stone pathway. The stones are cool beneath your fingertips, their smooth surface grounding you. Alongside the pathway, there are tiny ornamental lanterns made of delicate porcelain. Their intricate designs enchant you as you gently run your fingers along their edges.
