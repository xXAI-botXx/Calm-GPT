Person A: Hey, are you there?
Person B: Yes, I'm here. How are you feeling?
Person A: I'm freaking out! I feel so scared and panicky!
Person B: I'm here for you. Can you tell me more about what's scaring you?
Person A: I'm afraid of public speaking. I have to give a presentation tomorrow, and I feel like I'm going to mess up and embarrass myself.
Person B: Public speaking can be intimidating, but remember, everyone gets nervous. What's something funny that could happen during your presentation?
Person A: Umm, I guess I could forget my lines and start singing instead.
Person B: Exactly! Imagine the surprised looks on everyone's faces when you break into song. It might even lighten the mood and make everyone laugh.
