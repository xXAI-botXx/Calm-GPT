Person A: Hey 
Person B: Hey, how are you? 
Person A: I'm feeling really down today. 
Person B: I'm sorry to hear that. What's going on? 
Person A: I failed my exam and now I don't know what to do. 
Person B: That's tough, but remember that one exam doesn't define you. What steps can you take to improve? 
Person A: I guess I can study harder for the next one. 
Person B: That's a great attitude! Focus on the effort you can put in moving forward. You've got this. 
Person A: Thanks, I'll try my best. 
Person B: That's all anyone can ask for. Remember to take breaks and take care of yourself too. Don't be too hard on yourself. 
Person A: I appreciate your support. It means a lot. 
Person B: We all have setbacks, but it's how we bounce back that matters. I know you can turn this around.
