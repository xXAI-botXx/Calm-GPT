User: What lies inside the temple?

Storyteller: Patience, my friend. As you step through its magnificent entrance, the atmosphere changes. The gentle rays of sunlight filter through the cracks and illuminate the center of the temple, revealing a serene stone pool. The water is crystal clear, reflecting the surrounding greenery, creating a mesmerizing play of light and shadow.
