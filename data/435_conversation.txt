Person A: Hey, I wanted to talk to you about something that has been bothering me lately. I've been diagnosed with Undifferentiated Somatoform Disorder.

Person B: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about it?

Person A: Well, it's a condition where I experience a lot of physical symptoms without any clear medical explanation. It's been really distressing because I never know what's causing these symptoms.

Person B: That must be tough for you. How do you cope with it?

Person A: Honestly, it's been difficult. I often feel anxious and frustrated because it's hard to live with uncertainty and not knowing why I'm experiencing these symptoms.

Person B: I can imagine how frustrating that must be. Have you sought any treatment or support?

Person A: Yes, I am seeing a therapist and trying various coping techniques. It's just a long process, and sometimes it feels overwhelming. 

Person B: It's great that you're seeking help. Remember, progress takes time, and it's important to be patient with yourself. Is there anything specific that triggers your symptoms?

Person A: Not really, it seems to happen randomly. That's what makes it even more challenging.

Person B: I understand. Have you tried any relaxation techniques or mindfulness exercises to help calm your mind and body during those episodes?

Person A: Oh, yes! I've been practicing deep breathing and meditation, and it does help me relax a bit when the symptoms arise.

Person B: That's fantastic, keep up with those practices. It's great to see you actively working on managing your symptoms. Remember, I'm here for you if you ever need to talk or need any support.

Person A: Thank you so much for being understanding. It means a lot to me, especially during those moments when I feel overwhelmed.

Person B: Of course, anytime! Remember, you're not alone in this. You're strong, and you'll get through this.
