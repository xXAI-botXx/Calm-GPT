Person A: I used to enjoy reading and going for walks, but I haven't done those things in a while.
Person B: It might be helpful for you to set aside some time each day for activities that bring you joy and help you relax. Is there a specific reason why you haven't been doing them?
Person A: I guess I've just been prioritizing work and putting my own needs last.

Person A: I can start by scheduling some time for reading and going for walks, even if it's just for a short while.
