Patient: Good morning, Dr. Smith. 
Psychologist: Good morning! How are you feeling today? 
Patient: I've been feeling really anxious lately. I've been having trouble sleeping and my thoughts are racing all the time. 
Psychologist: I see. Anxiety can really interfere with our daily lives. Can you tell me what specifically has been causing your anxiety? 
Patient: Well, I recently started a new job and I feel overwhelmed by all the new responsibilities. I'm constantly worrying about making mistakes and not meeting expectations. 
Psychologist: It sounds like you're putting a lot of pressure on yourself. Remember that it's okay to make mistakes and ask for help when needed. Have you spoken to your supervisor about your concerns? 
Patient: No, I haven't. I feel like they would see it as a sign of weakness. 
Psychologist: Opening up about your struggles can actually show strength and demonstrate that you are proactive about your well-being. I encourage you to have an open and honest conversation with your supervisor. 
Patient: I'll try, but I still feel like I might disappoint them. 
Psychologist: It's common to fear disappointment, but remember that you have value beyond your job performance. Your worth is not solely defined by how well you do at work. Let's work on building your self-esteem and focusing on your strengths, okay? 
Patient: That sounds like a good plan. Thank you for your guidance, Dr. Smith. 
Psychologist: You're welcome. Remember, you're not alone in this. I'm here to support you on your journey towards managing your anxiety. 
Patient: I appreciate that. It gives me some comfort knowing that I have someone to talk to. 
Psychologist: I'm here for you every step of the way. We'll work together to develop coping strategies and find ways to reduce your anxiety. 
Patient: Thank you, Dr. Smith. I'm looking forward to our next session. 
Psychologist: See you then. Take care in the meantime.
