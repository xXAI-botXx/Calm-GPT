Person A: Hey
Person B: Hey, how are you feeling today?
Person A: I've been feeling really stressed lately.
Person B: I see, what's been causing you stress?
Person A: Work has been overwhelming and I'm having trouble managing my time.
Person B: It sounds like you're carrying a lot on your plate. Have you considered delegating some tasks or asking for help?
Person A: I haven't thought about that. I guess I just feel like I should be able to handle everything on my own.
Person B: It's completely normal to feel that way, but remember that you don't have to do it all by yourself. It's okay to reach out for support when you need it.
Person A: You're right. I'll try talking to my supervisor about redistributing some of my workload.
Person B: That sounds like a good plan. Remember, taking care of yourself and setting boundaries is important too. How else can I support you?
Person A: Just talking about it helps a lot. Thank you for listening and giving me some perspective.
Person B: Anytime! Remember, self-care is crucial. Let me know if there's anything else I can do to support you.
