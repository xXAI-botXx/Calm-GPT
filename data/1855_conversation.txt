Storyteller: Wonderful! We continue our journey and soon arrive at a vast meadow. The sun is gently setting, casting a warm, golden glow over the landscape. Walk into the meadow and notice how the soft grass embraces your feet with each step. Look up at the sky, adorned with a breathtaking display of colors. Can you feel the peace within?
