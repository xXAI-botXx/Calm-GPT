Storyteller: Indeed. And while we continue our walk, let's pause for a moment. Close your eyes again and imagine the scent of the shopping mall. Is it the aroma of freshly brewed coffee, wafting from a nearby café? Or perhaps it's the faint hint of perfume as someone walks past you. Take a deep breath and let these scents embrace your senses.

Storyteller: Beautiful. Now, as we walk further, let's focus on the feeling of the ground beneath your feet. Imagine the slight bounce in each step, as if the floor is softly supporting and energizing you. Feel your posture straighten, your worries melt away, and your mind becoming present in the here and now.
