Person A: Hey, are you there?
Person B: Yes, I'm here for you. How are you feeling?
Person A: I'm really scared. I keep having panic attacks.
Person B: I understand, but remember that we can work through this together. You're not alone.
Person A: I can't control it. It's overwhelming.
Person B: It's completely normal to feel overwhelmed, but it's important to remind yourself that these panic attacks will pass. Take some deep breaths with me.
Person A: *takes deep breaths* Okay, I'm trying.
Person B: That's great! Remember, you've overcome these panic attacks before, and you can do it again. Focus on the positive outcomes.
Person A: It's hard to see any positive outcomes right now.
Person B: I know it feels that way, but let's take a moment to think about all the times you've faced your fears and come out stronger on the other side. You have the strength within you.
Person A: I guess you're right. I have overcome challenges before.
Person B: Exactly! And you'll continue to do so. You are resilient and capable of handling anything that comes your way.
Person A: Thank you for reminding me of that. I needed to hear it.
Person B: You're welcome. Just remember, even during challenging times, you have the power to control your thoughts and emotions. You are stronger than your fears.
Person A: I'll try my best to remember that. Thank you for being there for me.
Person B: Anytime. I'm here to support you every step of the way. Just know that you're not alone in this journey. We'll get through it together.
