Person A: I'm really anxious about the future. I don't know what's going to happen and it scares me.

Person B: Take a deep breath and try to calm down. Everything will be fine, I promise. 

Person A: But how can you be so sure? I can't stop thinking about what might go wrong.

Person B: It's natural to feel anxious, especially when we can't predict the future. But worrying about it won't change anything. Instead, why not focus on the present moment?

Person A: I guess you're right. It's just hard not to let my thoughts spiral out of control.

Person B: I understand. Accept that feeling of anxiety, but don't let it consume you. Acceptance doesn't mean giving up; it means acknowledging that this is how you're feeling right now. 

Person A: I'm trying my best to accept it, but it's still overwhelming.

Person B: That's okay. Remember, you're not alone in this. Share your concerns with those you trust, and let them provide support and reassurance. And as time goes on, things will naturally get better. 

Person A: I really hope so. Thank you for being here and giving me some perspective.

Person B: You're welcome. Just know that you're stronger than you think, and you will overcome this. Take it one day at a time and believe that things will improve.
