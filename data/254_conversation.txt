Person A: Oh no, I'm freaking out! I feel so overwhelmed with anxiety right now.

Person B: Take a deep breath... Inhale... Exhale... Now, I want you to think of three random words. Can you do that for me?

Person A: Um... okay... car, banana, and umbrella.

Person B: Great! Now close your eyes and imagine this vividly: Picture yourself driving a car, but instead of wheels, it has giant bananas for tires. And as you drive down the street, rain starts pouring, so you extend your umbrella out of the car's window to stay dry. Can you see it?

Person A: *laughs* Yes, that's hilarious!

Person B: Good! Now, every time you start feeling overwhelmed, just think of that ridiculous image, and it will help put things into perspective. Life is full of unexpected and humorous moments, even in the midst of anxiety. You can conquer this!

Person A: Thank you so much for your help. I feel so much better now.

Person B: You're welcome! Remember, laughter is often the best medicine. Take care, and if you ever need someone to talk to, I'm here for you.
