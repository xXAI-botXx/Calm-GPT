Patient: Hello, I'm here for my appointment with the psychologist. 
Psychologist: Welcome, please have a seat. How can I help you today? 
Patient: Well, I've been feeling quite anxious lately. I've been having trouble sleeping and sometimes I even have panic attacks. 
Psychologist: I see. Can you tell me more about what triggers these anxious feelings? 
Patient: It's mostly triggered by social situations. I start overthinking and worrying about what others think of me. 
Psychologist: That sounds like social anxiety. Have you always felt this way, or did it start recently? 
Patient: It started a few years ago, but it has been getting worse over time. 
Psychologist: I understand. It's common for social anxiety to intensify if not addressed. Let's work on some techniques to manage these anxious feelings. Have you tried any coping mechanisms before? 
Patient: I've tried deep breathing and positive self-talk, but they don't seem to have a lasting effect. 
Psychologist: That's alright. Everyone responds differently to different techniques. Let's explore some alternative methods together to find what works best for you. 
Patient: Thank you, I really appreciate that. 
Psychologist: You're welcome. Remember, this is a journey and it might take time, but we will work together to overcome your social anxiety.
