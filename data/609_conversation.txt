Person A: Hey, can I talk to you about something that's been bothering me?
Person B: Of course, I'm here to listen. What's on your mind?
Person A: Well, I've been feeling really overwhelmed with my workload lately. There are so many deadlines and expectations, and I just can't seem to keep up.
Person B: It sounds like you're under a lot of pressure. I can understand how that can make you feel overwhelmed. Is there anything specific that's been causing you the most stress?
Person A: Yes, there is this one project that I'm struggling with. The client keeps changing their requirements, and it's making it difficult for me to meet their expectations.
Person B: That sounds really challenging. It can be frustrating when expectations keep changing, and it's understandable that it's causing you stress. Have you talked to your manager or the client about this?
Person A: I haven't yet, but maybe I should. I just don't want to disappoint anyone.
Person B: I understand that you want to meet everyone's expectations, but it's important to prioritize your well-being too. It might be helpful to discuss your concerns and workload with your manager, so they can better support you.
Person A: You're right, I need to take care of myself too. Thanks for reminding me. It just feels good to have someone who understands and listens.
Person B: I'm glad that I could be here for you. Remember, you don't have to go through this alone. Whenever you need to talk, I'm here to listen and support you.
