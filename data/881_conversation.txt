Person A: Hi, I wanted to talk to you about something. It's a little difficult for me, but I trust you.

Person B: Of course, you can share anything with me. I'm here to listen. What's on your mind?

Person A: Well, I have this thing called Selective Mutism. It's a condition where I find it really hard to speak in certain situations or with certain people.

Person B: Oh, I see. Thank you for opening up about it. I'm really glad you told me, and I will do my best to understand and support you. Can you tell me more about it?

Person A: Of course, thank you for being so understanding. It's like a fear of speaking, even when I want to. It's not that I don't have anything to say, but the words just won't come out.

Person B: That must be really challenging for you. I can't even imagine how it feels, but I really admire your bravery in sharing it with me. Is there anything I can do to help or support you?

Person A: Honestly, just being patient and understanding means the world to me. Sometimes, it helps if someone initiates the conversation and gives me some time to feel comfortable enough to respond.

Person B: Absolutely, I completely understand. I'll make sure to create a safe and comfortable environment for you to feel at ease. And remember, there's no rush – take all the time you need.

Person A: Thank you so much. Your positivity and support mean everything to me. It's really reassuring to know that I have someone like you who genuinely cares.

Person B: You're welcome, my friend. I just want you to know that you're not alone in this. I'm here to listen, talk, or even just sit quietly with you – whatever you need. We'll navigate this together, okay?

Person A: I can't express how grateful I am for your understanding and willingness to help. It truly means the world to me. Thank you for being there for me.

Person B: It's my pleasure, and I'll always be here for you. You're an incredible person, and together, we'll find ways to overcome any challenges that come your way. Keep being you, and remember, you're never alone in this journey.
