Storyteller: Ah, clouds... they are fascinating, aren't they? Picture yourself lying down in an open field, surrounded by the softness of the green grass. Take a deep breath in through your nose and feel the coolness of the air filling your lungs. As you exhale through your mouth, let your body relax, feeling the tension melt away.

User: That sounds lovely.

Storyteller: Wonderful! Let your mind wander as you discover more shapes and wonders. Spot a cloud that resembles your favorite animal and take a moment to appreciate its presence. As you do, inhale deeply, and as you exhale, release any lingering tension.
