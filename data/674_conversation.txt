Person B: Really? I'm sorry to hear that. What exactly does that mean?

Person A: Well, it means that my anxiety symptoms are caused by substance abuse or certain medications I've been taking. It's been tough to deal with.

Person B: I can only imagine how challenging that must be for you. How are you coping with it?

Person A: It's been a rollercoaster of emotions, to be honest. I feel anxious and on edge most of the time, and it's affecting my daily life. I'm constantly worried about things that normally wouldn't bother me.

Person B: That sounds really tough, but I want you to know that I'm here for you. Is there anything specific that triggers your anxiety?

Person A: Sometimes it's triggered by certain medications I've taken, and other times it's related to substances like caffeine or alcohol. It's frustrating because I used to be able to enjoy these things without any issues.

Person B: I understand how frustrating that can be. Have you talked to your doctor about managing these triggers or finding alternatives that won't worsen your anxiety?

Person A: Yes, I have. They suggested exploring different treatment options, including therapy and medication adjustment. I'm hoping that with the right help, I can find a way to manage my anxiety and get back to feeling like myself.
