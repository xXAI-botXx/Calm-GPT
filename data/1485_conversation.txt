Person A: Hey, I've been feeling really down lately.
Person B: I'm here for you. What's been going on?

Person A: I just can't seem to find any motivation for anything.
Person B: It's completely normal to go through periods of low motivation. Have you been experiencing any other changes in your life?

Person A: Yeah, I've also been having trouble sleeping at night.
Person B: Lack of sleep can definitely contribute to feeling down. Have you tried any relaxation techniques before bed?

Person A: I've tried some deep breathing exercises, but they haven't helped much.
Person B: It's great that you're trying different techniques. Maybe we can explore some other options together. Have you considered trying meditation or reading before bed?

Person A: I haven't tried those yet, but I'm willing to give it a go. Do you have any other suggestions?
Person B: Definitely! Another option could be journaling your thoughts and emotions before bed. It can help clear your mind and promote better sleep. Would you like me to look up more techniques for you?

Person A: That would be really helpful, thank you. I appreciate your support.
Person B: You're welcome. Remember, I'm here for you whenever you need someone to talk to.
