User: The water looks so inviting. I can almost hear it calling me.
Storyteller: Very good. Now, reach out and dip your fingers into the cool lake. Feel a sense of peace simply by being close to such serenity. You look up and notice a bird gracefully gliding through the air, creating patterns in the sky. Allow your breath to mimic the bird's graceful movements.
