Therapist: Good morning, how are you feeling today?
Patient: I'm feeling really overwhelmed and anxious. I just can't seem to calm down.
Therapist: I understand that it's a struggle right now, but remember that you're not alone in this. Take a deep breath and try to relax your body.
Patient: I've been trying, but it feels like nothing is working. Maybe I'm just not cut out to handle all of this stress.
Therapist: It's completely normal to feel that way, but I want you to know that you are stronger than you think. You have overcome challenges before and you can do it again.
Patient: I don't know, it just feels like everything is piling up and I can't catch a break.
Therapist: I hear you, and it's okay to feel overwhelmed. But instead of focusing on everything that's going wrong, let's shift our focus to what you can do to take care of yourself right now.
Patient: I guess I could try doing something I enjoy, like painting or going for a walk.
Therapist: That's a great idea! Doing something you enjoy will help distract you from the stress and give you a sense of control. Remember, self-care is essential for your well-being.
Patient: You're right. I need to prioritize taking care of myself. Thank you for reminding me of that.
Therapist: You're welcome! Remember, you are deserving of happiness and peace. You have the strength within you to overcome anything.
