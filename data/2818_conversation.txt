Storyteller: How lovely. As you walk further into your home, imagine your favorite place to relax. Is there a specific spot that brings you great calm and comfort?

User: Yes, there's a large, cushioned window seat by the bay window. It overlooks a peaceful garden filled with vibrant flowers, swaying gently in the breeze.

Storyteller: That sounds like the perfect place for relaxation. As you settle down on the window seat, notice how the sun's rays softly caress your skin, warming you from head to toe. Feel the softness of the cushion beneath you and the gentle support it provides.

User: It's so soothing. I can almost feel the warmth and comfort surrounding me.
