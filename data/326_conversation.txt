Person A: I can't stop feeling this overwhelming sense of panic and fear. Everything just seems so scary right now.

Person B: I'm here for you, and I want to understand exactly what you're feeling. Can you tell me more about the specific fear or issue that's causing you such distress?

Person A: It's hard to pinpoint one thing in particular. It's more like a general feeling of impending doom. I keep thinking about all the bad things that could happen.

Person B: I completely understand how that feels. But let me try and give you a different perspective to lighten the mood. Have you ever considered that if gravity suddenly disappeared, we would all just float around like balloons? Imagine how silly it would be floating through the air, trying to hold on to things. 

Person A: (laughs) That's actually a hilarious visual! I can't help but picturing it in my mind. It's definitely making me feel better and distracting me from all the scary thoughts.

Person B: Exactly! Sometimes it helps to shift our focus and think about something completely absurd. It can be a great way to break the cycle of fear and anxiety. 

Person A: You're right. It's important not to take everything so seriously and to find the humor in things. Thank you for being here and helping me through this.

Person B: Of course, anytime! Just remember, I'm always here to offer a listening ear, a different perspective, or even a funny anecdote. We'll get through this together.
