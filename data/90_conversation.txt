Person A: I don't know what to do! I'm feeling so panicked and overwhelmed right now.
Person B: Hey, take a deep breath. I understand how you feel. Once, I was in a similar situation and let me tell you about it. 
Person A: Okay, go ahead. Maybe hearing your story will help distract me.
Person B: So, a couple of years ago, I was in the middle of planning my wedding and everything seemed to be turning into chaos. The florist canceled last minute, the venue double-booked, and the caterer went out of business. I was on the verge of a breakdown!
Person A: Wow, that sounds really stressful. How did you manage to cope with all of that?
Person B: Well, I realized that getting overwhelmed wouldn't solve anything. Instead, I focused on finding solutions step by step. I delegated tasks to my friends and family, called in favors, and even found a better venue and caterer in the end.
Person A: That sounds like a lot of work, but also really inspiring. I guess I need to take a step back and figure out the logical next steps to solve my problem.
Person B: Exactly! Sometimes, taking a breather and looking at the bigger picture can help you find the right path forward. Trust me, you'll get through this just fine.
