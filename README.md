### Guide

### Description

A GPT2 model is to be extended to a new task via transfer learning. The GPT2 model is to be fine-tuned so that it acts as a "talk down" for anxiety/panic attacks. <br>
The model should therefore act as a chatbot. The communication participant should be positively encouraged and reassured.
The functionality of the bot is therefore similar to Eliza.<br>
The language is English and the model is to be deployed as a chatbot on Discord.<br>
The training data requires positive conversations that are relaxed and reassuring. The conversation should be sensitive and emotional, but with a certain lightness.<br>
The chatbot should therefore make reassuring statements at the end. It should remain rational and focus on the "here and now". It could possibly teach small tasks/relaxation techniques.<br>
Since such training data is difficult to obtain, ChatGPT is used to generate the data.<br>

<br>

The GPT3 model would actually be used for this, but this is associated with costs, so the decision was made to use the GPT2 model.<br>

### Definition Talk Down:
A "talk down" for anxiety usually refers to a technique used in cognitive behavioral therapy. It is a type of self-talk in which you make reassuring and rational statements to yourself in order to reduce the intensity of your anxiety. <br>
A "talk down" for anxiety involves several key attributes: <br>
1. self-soothing: You make soothing statements to yourself to reduce the intensity of the anxiety. This can include things like "I'm safe" or "This is only temporary".

2. rational thoughts: You try to replace the irrational fears you have with rational and logical thoughts. For example, you could say to yourself: "There is no real reason for this fear".

3. mindfulness: focus on the here and now instead of focusing on the future or the past. This can help to reduce anxiety by focusing on what is happening right now rather than what might happen.

4. relaxation techniques: Techniques such as deep breathing or progressive muscle relaxation can help to alleviate the physical symptoms of anxiety.

   


### Project Milestones:
- Traindata (dialogs) with ChatGPT are generated
- A GPT2 model was trained/finetuned with the training data
- The bot got deployed on Discord over replit



### Advantages and Disadvantages

Pros:

- for free
- every time
- everywhere where you have network connection
- 100% private (only Discord could save the chat)



Cons:

- Only a "bot"
- May not answer well every time
- Can give wrong tips and advises



### Branches

- main = contains the trained model and scripts to train the model
- every other branch is a platform integration (Discord, Mobile, Desktop,...)
