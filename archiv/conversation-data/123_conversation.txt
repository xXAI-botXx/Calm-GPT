Person A: I just can't stop worrying about the future. It's giving me so much anxiety.

Person B: I understand how you feel, but try not to let your worries consume you. Everything will be fine, I promise.

Person A: How can you be so sure? I feel like everything is spinning out of control.

Person B: I know it's hard to see right now, but all we can do is accept our feelings and trust that things will work out. Worrying won't change the outcome, but it will only make you feel worse.

Person A: But what if things don't get better? What if I'm stuck in this anxious state forever?

Person B: It's normal to have these doubts, but remember that anxiety is not a permanent state. It may feel overwhelming right now, but it won't last forever. Be patient with yourself and have faith in your ability to overcome this.

Person A: I just wish I could snap out of it. I hate feeling like this.

Person B: I know it's tough, but try not to fight against your anxiety. Instead, embrace it as a temporary state of being. Acknowledge that it's okay to feel anxious and don't beat yourself up about it. Give yourself time and space to heal, and soon you'll start feeling better.

Person A: Thank you for your support. It means a lot to me.

Person B: You're welcome. Remember, you're not alone in this. We'll get through it together. Just take it one day at a time and focus on the present moment.
