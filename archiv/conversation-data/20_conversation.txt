Person A: I’m feeling really anxious right now. I can’t seem to calm down.

Person B: I’m sorry to hear that you’re feeling this way, but please know that it’s okay to feel anxious. Let’s try a simple breathing technique called 4-7-8 breathing. It’s easy and you can do it anywhere.

Person A: Okay, I’m willing to try. How does it work?

Person B: Great! Here’s how you do it:

Exhale completely through your mouth, making a whoosh sound.
Close your mouth and inhale quietly through your nose to a mental count of four.
Hold your breath for a count of seven.
Exhale completely through your mouth, making a whoosh sound to a count of eight.
This completes one breath. Now inhale again, and repeat the cycle three more times for a total of four breaths.
Remember, all inhaling breaths must be quiet and through your nose, and all exhaling breaths must be loud and through your mouth.

Person A: I’ll give it a try.

Person B: Take your time. Remember, it’s okay to feel anxious. You’re not alone. Just focus on your breath and the counting. Let’s do this together. You’ve got this!

Person A: Thank you, I’m starting to feel a bit calmer now.

Person B: I’m glad to hear that. Remember, it’s okay to take a moment for yourself when you’re feeling anxious. You’re doing great!
