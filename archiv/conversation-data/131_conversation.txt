Person A: I'm really anxious about the future. I don't know what's going to happen and it's driving me crazy.

Person B: Take a deep breath. It's understandable to feel anxious about the future, but remember that you can't control everything. Sometimes, all we can do is accept the feeling and trust that things will work out in the end.

Person A: But what if things don't work out? What if everything falls apart?

Person B: We can never predict the future with certainty, but worrying about it won't change anything. Instead, focus on what you can control in the present moment and trust that things will fall into place. Remember, worrying won't solve anything.

Person A: I know, but it's just hard to stop the thoughts from racing through my mind.

Person B: It's completely normal to have thoughts racing through your mind when you're feeling anxious. Instead of trying to fight against them, try to acknowledge them and let them pass. Remember, thoughts are just thoughts, they don't have to define your reality.

Person A: That's true, I guess I just need to accept that I can't do anything about it right now.

Person B: Exactly. Acceptance is key. Sometimes, we have to surrender to the fact that we can't control everything and trust that things will work out for the best. Give yourself permission to let go of the need to predict the future and focus on finding peace in the present moment.

Person A: You're right. I'll try to take it one day at a time and stop trying to predict the future. Thank you for calming me down.

Person B: You're welcome. Remember, everything will be fine. Just take a deep breath, accept the feeling, and have faith that it will get better soon. You can do this.
