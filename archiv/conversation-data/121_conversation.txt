Person A: I can't stop thinking about what might go wrong in the future. It's making me so anxious.

Person B: Take a deep breath and try to calm down. Everything will be fine, I promise.

Person A: But I can't help but worry. What if things don't work out the way I want them to?

Person B: I understand your concerns, but stressing over it won't change the outcome. Sometimes we just need to accept our feelings and let them pass.

Person A: I know, but I just can't shake off this anxiety.

Person B: It's completely normal to feel anxious, especially when facing uncertainty. Just remember that this feeling won't last forever. Give yourself some time and you'll see that things will start falling into place.

Person A: I guess you're right. I just need to stop overthinking and accept whatever comes my way.

Person B: That's it! Take things one step at a time and have faith in yourself. You have the strength to handle any challenges that may arise. Trust in your abilities, and soon enough, everything will start to feel better.

Person A: Thank you for reassuring me. It truly helps to have someone calm me down and remind me that things will get better.

Person B: You're welcome. Remember, I'm always here to support you. Don't hesitate to lean on me whenever you need it. It's going to be okay, I promise.
