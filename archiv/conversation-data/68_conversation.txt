Person A: Hey, I wanted to talk to you about something that's been bothering me lately. I've been diagnosed with Substance/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder, and it's been really tough to handle.

Person B: Oh, I'm really sorry to hear that. I'm here to listen. What exactly does that mean?

Person A: Well, it means that certain substances or medications I've taken have triggered severe anxiety symptoms in me. It feels like a constant battle of worrying and feeling on edge.

Person B: That must be really challenging for you. Have you spoken to a professional about it? They might be able to offer some guidance.

Person A: Yes, I have. They've provided some coping strategies and I'm also on medication to help manage the symptoms. But sometimes it just feels so overwhelming, you know?

Person B: I can only imagine how tough it can be. But it's great that you're taking steps to tackle it. Are there any specific triggers that you've identified?

Person A: Yes, certain medications and substances like caffeine, nicotine, or even some prescription drugs have been known to set off my anxiety. So, I have to be really cautious about what I put into my body.

Person B: That's quite a list to be mindful of. But with time and practice, I'm sure you'll be able to identify and avoid those triggers more easily. What are some strategies your therapist has suggested?

Person A: Deep breathing exercises, practicing mindfulness, and finding healthy ways to distract myself when anxiety hits are some of the techniques I've been working on. They do help, but sometimes it's just really overwhelming.

Person B: I can see how it can get overwhelming, but remember, progress takes time. It's important to celebrate even the small victories along the way. And don't hesitate to ask for support whenever you need it. We're always here for you.

Person A: Thank you. It really means a lot to know that I have your support. Sometimes it's difficult to stay positive, but having someone who understands and cares makes a huge difference.

Person B: Absolutely! I'm here to cheer you on every step of the way. You're incredibly resilient, and I truly believe that with time and the right strategies, you'll be able to manage your anxiety disorder and live a fulfilling life.
