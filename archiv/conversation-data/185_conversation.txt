Person A: Oh no, I can't find my car keys! I've searched everywhere and I'm starting to panic!

Person B: Take a deep breath, it's going to be okay. Let's try to distract you from this problem. How about playing a game of "I Spy"? 

Person A: I don't know... I feel so stressed, but I'll give it a try. 

Person B: Great! So, I'll start. I spy with my little eye, something green. 

Person A: Hmmm... Is it that potted plant over there? 

Person B: Yes, you got it! Your turn now. 

Person A: Alright, I spy with my little eye, something blue. 

Person B: Is it the blue pen on the desk? 

Person A: Yes, you're good at this! 

Person B: It's just a fun way to take our minds off things. Let's keep playing. I spy with my little eye, something yellow. 

Person A: Is it the yellow picture frame on the wall? 

Person B: You're on fire! You guessed it - well done! 

Person A: This game is actually helping me relax a bit. Thanks for suggesting it. 

Person B: You're welcome! Sometimes a little distraction can go a long way in calming our minds. We're almost there, keep playing. 

Person A: Okay, I spy with my little eye, something silver. 

Person B: Is it the silver keychain by the door? 

Person A: Yes, exactly! That's where my car keys were hiding all along. You're amazing! 

Person B: I'm glad we could find them together. See, a little game can do wonders. 

(Person A and Person B continue playing the game and slowly the panic subsides.)
