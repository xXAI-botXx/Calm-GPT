Person A: I’m feeling really anxious right now. I can’t seem to calm down.

Person B: I’m sorry to hear that you’re feeling this way. But remember, it’s okay to feel anxious. We all do at times. Let’s try a simple breathing technique together. It’s called the 4-7-8 breathing technique.

Person A: What’s the 4-7-8 breathing technique?

Person B: It’s a simple technique that involves breathing in for 4 seconds, holding the breath for 7 seconds, and exhaling for 8 seconds. This process is repeated for four breath cycles. It helps to reduce anxiety and induce sleep.

Person A: Okay, I’m willing to try. What should I do first?

Person B: First, find a comfortable place to sit or lie down. Close your eyes and take a deep breath in through your nose for a count of 4 seconds.

Person A: Alright, I’ve done that. What’s next?

Person B: Now, hold your breath for a count of 7 seconds. After that, exhale slowly through your mouth for a count of 8 seconds. Repeat this cycle four times.

Person A: I’ll give it a try. Thank you for your help.

Person B: You’re welcome. Remember, it’s okay to feel anxious. Just take it one breath at a time. You’re doing great.
