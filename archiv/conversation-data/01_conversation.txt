Person A: I’m feeling really scared right now. My heart is racing and I can’t seem to calm down.
Person B: I’m here for you. Remember, it’s okay to feel scared. But let’s try to focus on your breathing. Take a deep breath in, hold it for a moment, and then slowly let it out. Do this a few times.
Person A: I’m trying, but it’s hard. I can’t stop thinking about all the things that could go wrong.
Person B: It’s natural to worry, but sometimes our minds can get carried away with negative thoughts. Let’s try a different approach. Can you think of something positive that happened today?
Person A: Well, I had a really good breakfast this morning. That was nice.
Person B: That’s great! Hold onto that positive memory. Remember how it made you feel. Let’s try to bring some of that positivity into this moment.
Person A: I’ll try. It’s just hard to think positively when I’m feeling like this.
Person B: I understand. Remember, it’s okay to have these feelings. You’re not alone. And remember, this feeling is temporary. It will pass. Just keep focusing on your breathing and the positive thoughts.
Person A: Thank you. I’ll keep trying.
Person B: That’s all anyone can ask for. You’re doing great. Remember, it’s okay to reach out for help when you need it. You’re not alone in this.
