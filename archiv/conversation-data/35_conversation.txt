Person A: I'm really anxious right now. I can't stop thinking about the future and it's making me so stressed out.

Person B: Hey, take a deep breath. Everything will be fine, I promise. It's normal to feel anxious sometimes, but you don't have to let it consume you.

Person A: I know I shouldn't worry too much, but it's hard not to. I just can't help but think about all the what-ifs.

Person B: I understand, but remember that worrying about the future won't change anything. Sometimes, we just have to accept our feelings and let them run their course.

Person A: I guess you're right. It's just tough to not have control over these thoughts and emotions.

Person B: It is tough, but try to focus on the things you can control in the present moment. Take small steps towards managing your anxiety, like deep breathing exercises or engaging in activities that bring you joy.

Person A: I'll try my best. It's comforting to know that this feeling won't last forever.

Person B: Exactly. Anxiety comes and goes, and it will pass. Just remember to be patient with yourself and practice self-care. Things will get better soon, I promise.

Person A: Thank you for being here for me. Talking to you really helps me calm down.

Person B: Anytime. Remember, you're not alone in this. Lean on your support system and take it one day at a time. You'll get through this.
